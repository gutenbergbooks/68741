<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>For some time I have felt the need for a satisfactory
definition of the “classic” novel,—a definition which should
include novels of value, and exclude innumerable works of
fiction of little or no value. The want of such a definition
was evident not only from the vagueness with which literary
historians have referred to the “classic” novel, but also
from the fact that other students seemed to consider as
such any work of fiction using Greek and Roman names.
For a definite selection of theme, I am indebted to Dr. John
Cooper Mendenhall, of the Department of English of the
University of Pennsylvania, whose generous advice I wish
to acknowledge most gratefully, and whose fine sense for
literary form has been an inspiration to me in my work. I
wish to express my most sincere appreciation for many
helpful suggestions, to other members of the Department of
English, whose lectures have provided, I feel, a background
for this study. I have also to thank Dr. Eugene Stock
McCartney, of the University of Michigan, for freely providing
me with a list of titles, which has materially aided
me in making complete my list of all works of fiction dealing
with ancient Rome.</p>

<p>It is my purpose in this study to show the use which the
English historical novel has made of the rich and abundant
material furnished by the life of ancient Rome. In doing
this I shall trace the genesis of the novel of Roman life and
its development, with special emphasis upon elements of
permanent value. As an aid to a clear perception of this
latter point, I shall give a carefully selected list of the best
novels of Roman life, pointing out their claims to greatness.
At the end of my study will be found a complete list of all
books which make any pretense of presenting Roman life
in the form of a novel.</p>

<p>Since ancient Rome is often associated with ancient
Greece in classical study, the question may arise as to why
novels dealing with life in ancient Greece are excluded from
consideration here. The answer is that comparatively few
such novels have been written. The author who writes of
ancient Rome has at his disposal abundant materials from
which he may construct a novel; he who writes of the life
of ancient Greece finds his sources somewhat more limited.
Another consideration which has influenced authors is that
modern life is more immediately related to the life of
ancient Rome than to that of ancient Greece. The classic
period of Greek history was of comparatively short duration,
and, in one sense, the life of ancient Greece lost its
identity even before it was absorbed by the life of the
Roman empire; while the life of ancient Rome made itself
felt in the most remote parts of the widely extended Roman
world. We must give full recognition to ancient Greece
for her contribution to the world’s culture, yet admit that
her influence upon the world today has been overshadowed
by the power of Rome. The story of Rome’s power, rather
than that of the culture of Greece, has found expression in
the modern novel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>A novelist who writes of ancient Rome may deal with any
period of Rome’s history, from the traditional date of the
founding of the city to the time at which Rome ceased to be
the head of the western Empire. A convenient division is
made when we speak of (1) Rome before the Empire, (2)
Rome under the Empire. Pre-imperial Rome has furnished
the inspiration for comparatively few novels. Since, however,
some of these are of great merit, it will be well to
examine certain portions of Rome’s early history with
which they are connected. One excellent novel<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> deals with
prehistoric Italy and the first faint beginnings of Roman
things. Immediately following the legendary period of her
existence, Rome was chiefly concerned with struggles with
her Italian neighbors; these struggles have inspired no
great novel in English, though several good books for boys
have been written about them. The desperate conflict
between Rome and Carthage offers material for a novel of
strong appeal. But the stirring times of the later Republic
present the best field for the novel of pre-Imperial Rome.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The period of the Empire, however, when Rome was undisputed
mistress of the world, is the time which has appealed
to most of the novelists who write of ancient Rome.</p>

<p>The number of novels or of books masquerading as
novels, which make some use of Roman life as a background,
is large; many of these purport to be what they
are not. So, if one reviews even a small portion of the
entire number, it becomes obvious that many, if not most
of them, are neither literature nor anything else of value.
There is one class of novels, whose purpose is not primarily
to represent life in ancient Rome, but to make other work
attractive by the addition of artificial coloring. The use of
such superficial aid in a novel nearly always reveals the
absence of any serious purpose. This lack of seriousness is
well illustrated by the work of Sir Rider Haggard in such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
pseudo-historical novels as <i>Cleopatra</i>, and <i>Pearl Maiden</i>.
A novel which seems to come a little closer to being truly
“historical,” is <i>Unto Caesar</i>, by the Baroness Orczy; but, on
closer examination, this book is found to belong to the
“artificial” class we are discussing. It makes use of a few
striking facts in the life of Caligula; but the deep significance
of these facts and of its quotations from the Bible, is
entirely lost, owing to the light and cheap sentimentality
which pervades the whole volume. A further illustration
of pseudo-sanctity is seen in the recently published novel of
Dr. Burris Jenkins, <i>Princess Salome</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> When fantastic and
improbable stories are woven around historical characters
in a novel; or when facts of deep historical significance are
made to aid the novelist in a frivolous pretense to serious
work; the result is sure to be a work of small merit. Novels
in which a supposed setting of Roman life merely conceals
inferior work and makes it appear attractive, will not be
considered in this study.</p>

<p>There is a second class of books whose chief purpose is
not portrayal of life in ancient Rome, but rather a kind of
religious propaganda. They set forth in the form of fiction,
some story inspired by the records of the New Testament,
or taken from the chronicles of Church history. Not
all of these books are to be called novels, but they have been
produced in large numbers, and have a significant relation
to the kind of novel we are considering. Many stories of
the early Christians, particularly of martyrs in the arena,
may be told in such a way as to portray the life of Rome
very inadequately. They often ignore the pagan point of
view, and in most cases deliberately misrepresent it. In
such a book as Cardinal Wiseman’s <i>Fabiola</i>, (1855), the
Emperor and his soldiers are mere abstract representatives
of power and evil; while the Christians artificially personify
virtue and martyrdom. The work of Mrs. J. B. Peploe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Webb is well represented by <i>Pomponia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a moral story of
supposed religious experience. Many such books have been
written since 1850, and published by religious publication
societies. They usually present merely a stereotyped
analysis of the character of some Christian martyr, while a
smattering of history is used to blindfold, rather than to
enlighten the reader. A novel which is truly to portray
the life of ancient Rome may well include within its scope
the life of the early Christians, but we shall not consider
those books which deliberately present either Christians or
pagans in a false light.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Of special interest to the teacher of history are juvenile
stories of Roman history, written for boys in fiction form,
since many of these truly portray a part of the life of
ancient Rome. It must be observed, however, that books
for boys are subject to some limitations not placed upon
novels written for their elders. Such well-known authors
of books for boys as the Rev. Alfred J. Church and G. A.
Henty have recognized that they must present a hero who
will appeal especially to boys, and that this hero must have
adventures illustrating schoolbook history. In Church’s
book <i>Two Thousand Years Ago</i>, Spartacus is represented
as a truly noble figure, while in <i>The Young Carthaginian</i>,
Henty makes Hannibal the real hero. But the technical
hero in each of these books is an idealized youth, who rushes
from one exciting adventure to another. Moreover, both
Church and Henty tried to make the study of history
instructive, by introducing into their fictions for boys favorite
incidents of the history books. The result was that their
novels for boys became too heavy with history. The general
criticism may also be made of such books for boys, that
they make too much use of the life of the soldier and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
gladiator, to the exclusion of other elements in Roman life.
There is, however, a fairly accurate portrayal of Roman
life, from a teacher’s point of view, in some books for boys;
such books are not to be confused with religious stories of
the Sunday-school type, and have a definite connection with
our subject.</p>

<p>After excluding novels which use Roman life merely to
make other work attractive, or as an artificial background
for religious instruction, we find that there still remain a
considerable number which attempt to portray Roman life,
but are unsuccessful. The novelist may fall short of his
aim through lack of scholarship, through want of appreciation
of the essential worth of his subject, or through
sheer inability to appeal to his readers directly. There may
be found on the shelves of public libraries, many novels, in
which the characters have Roman names and are supposed
to live in ancient Rome; but many of these novels do not
really portray the life of Rome at all. Some of them feebly
essay to imitate books of established reputation, and prove
to be very poor imitations. The present study will be
chiefly concerned with those novels which make a serious
portrayal of the life of ancient Rome for its own intrinsic
interest.</p>

<p>We are dealing then with that form of the historical
novel which portrays the life of ancient Rome. The historical
novel may be defined as that form of the novel which
makes use of historical characters and events as an integral
part of the story. Ample support may be found for this
definition in the always candid words of Sir Walter Scott,
the first really great English historical novelist, in his introductions
to the <i>Waverly Novels</i>. In the <i>Prefatory Letter</i>
to <i>Peveril of the Peak</i>, he has the anonymous “Author of
Waverly” say, “A poor fellow, like myself, weary with ransacking
his own barren and bounded imagination, looks out
for some general subject in the huge and boundless field
of history, which holds forth examples of every kind,—lights
on some personage, or some combination of circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
or some striking trait of manners, which he thinks
may be advantageously used as the basis of a fictitious narrative,
... invests it with such shades of character as
will best contrast with each other—and thinks, perhaps, he
has done some service to the public if he can present to
them a lively fictitious picture, for which the original anecdote
or circumstance which he made free to press into his
services, only furnishes a slight sketch.” Again, in the
introduction to <i>The Abbot</i>, Scott says, “I naturally paid
attention to such principles of composition, as I conceived
were best suited to the historical novel;” and this when he
has just made it clear that the choice of a famous historical
character<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> as subject is the readiest, though the most difficult,
way to instant success. In a note to the introduction
to <i>The Abbot</i>, he says, “There occur in every country
some peculiar historical characters, which are, like a spell
or charm, sovereign to excite curiosity and attract attention,
since every one in the slightest degree interested in the
land which they belong to, has heard much of them, and
longs to hear more.” The importance of a theme based on
famous historical events, to an historical novel, is attested
by Scott in his introduction to <i>Red Gauntlet</i>. Here he says,
“The Jacobite enthusiasm of the eighteenth century, particularly
during the rebellion of 1745, afforded a theme, perhaps
the finest that could be selected for fictitious composition,
founded upon real or probable incident.” In the
introduction to <i>Woodstock</i>, Scott says, “Nothing, indeed, is
more certain, than that incidents that are real, preserve an
infinite advantage in works of this nature (historical
novels) over such as are fictitious.” Not every novel which
tells a story of the past is a true historical novel; it must
make some vital use of historical characters and events if
it is to be considered truly historical.</p>

<p>But the function of the historical novel is not to teach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
history as it is taught by the schoolbook. It is rather to
aid the reader to a sympathetic appreciation of history in
the broader sense,—the history that reveals the life of the
past with all its significant relations to the life of the present.
As Scott explains, “The love of knowledge wants but
a beginning—the least spark will give fire when the train
is properly prepared; and having been interested in fictitious
adventures ascribed to an historical period and characters,
the reader begins next to be anxious to learn what
the facts really were, and how far the novelist has justly
represented them.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Moreover the aim of the best historical
novels is not to <i>escape</i> the present and carry the
reader back to the past, but to bring the present and the
past face to face,—in short, to portray life as it exists, and
always has existed. “The passions, the sources from which
(sentiments and manners) must spring in all their modifications,
are generally the same in all ranks and conditions,
all countries and ages; and it follows as a matter of
course, that the opinions, habits of thinking, and actions,
however influenced by the peculiar state of society, must
still, on the whole, bear a strong resemblance to each
other.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> An historical novel is great,—when it <i>is</i> great,—because,
in its study of the life of the past, it displays the
same qualities that give value to the life of today. The
true test of greatness in an historical novel may be defined
at once, as the test of its success in portraying the past
with realistic effect.</p>

<p>With this test in mind, I have reviewed all novels of
Roman life which a most thorough search has brought to
light, asking the question: What degree of success do they
attain in portraying the life of Rome with realistic effect?
This was done in order to obtain from a multitude of novels
of different degrees of merit, a standard representing the
best and most significant work that has been done in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
novel of Roman life. Judged according to this standard,
the best and most representative novels of Roman life are
those which appear in the following list. I have made this
list with the intention of basing upon it my deductions concerning
the achievement of English and American authors
in the field of the novel of Roman life.</p>

<p><i>Andivius Hedulio</i>: Edward Lucas White, (1921)</p>

<p><i>Pan and the Twins</i>: Eden Philpotts, (1922)</p>

</div>

<p>The above list represents my choice, based upon reasons
indicated, of the most important novels of Roman life. The
process of selection may be carried still further, however;
and, using the same standard as before, I have chosen from
this list a dozen novels which stand out above the rest, and
are to be considered the absolute best among novels of
Roman life. This more select list is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i>: Bulwer, (1834)</p>

<p>2. <i>Hypatia</i>: Charles Kingsley, (1853)</p>

<p>3. <i>The Gladiators</i>: G. J. Whyte-Melville, (1863)</p>

<p>4. <i>Ben Hur</i>: Lew Wallace, (1880)</p>

<p>5. <i>Marius, the Epicurean</i>: Walter Pater, (1885)</p>

<p>6. <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>: F. W. Farrar, (1892)</p>

<p>7. <i>Domitia</i>: S. Baring-Gould, (1898)</p>

<p>8. <i>A Friend of Caesar</i>: William Stearns Davis, (1900)</p>

<p>9. <i>Vergilius, a Tale of the Coming of Christ</i>: Irving
Bacheller, (1904)</p>

<p>10. <i>Veranilda</i>: George Gissing, (1904)</p>

<p>11. <i>Andivius Hedulio</i>: Edward Lucas White, (1921)</p>

<p>12. <i>Pan and the Twins</i>: Eden Philpotts, (1922)</p>

</div>

<p>These twelve novels are of permanent value. None of
them are either obsolete or obsolescent. But for the benefit
of those who raise the cry: “Of what practical good is anything
which does not satisfy the present popular taste?” I
wish to make an interesting comparison. After deciding
upon the above list of twelve novels, I came upon <i>A Classified
List of the Best Modern Novels that are in ACTIVE
USE in the Public Libraries of the United States</i>. This
was compiled with infinite pains by Mr. William Alanson
Borden, not with any scholarly purpose, but with a view to
ascertaining what novels were <i>most read</i>. While his list of
novels of Roman life stops at the year 1910, it can be seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
that it closely corresponds with the one I have just given.
His list of novels of Roman life, written in English, is as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p><i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i>: Bulwer</p>

<p><i>Hypatia</i>: Charles Kingsley (given under “Alexandria,”
not “Rome”)</p>

<p><i>Ben Hur</i>: Lew Wallace</p>

<p><i>Marius, the Epicurean</i>: Walter Pater</p>

<p><i>Domitia</i>: Baring-Gould</p>

<p><i>A Friend of Caesar</i>: W. S. Davis</p>

<p><i>Vergilius</i>: I. Bacheller</p>

<p>*<i>Aurelian</i>: William Ware</p>

<p>*<i>The Son of the Swordmaker</i>: Opie Read</p>

<p>*<i>The Sign of the Cross</i>: Wilson Barrett</p>

</div>

<p>Of the novels marked with an asterisk, <i>Aurelian</i> was
excluded from my list, as being somewhat too “gloomy” for
modern taste. <i>The Son of the Swordmaker</i> and <i>The Sign
of the Cross</i> were novels of widespread, but transient popularity.
This may be said also of <i>Vergilius</i>, but to a less
extent. The three novels on Mr. Borden’s list which I have
marked with an asterisk are the only ones which do not
appear of my list of the twelve best. On the whole, Mr.
Borden’s list of the best confirms my own, and the twelve
novels given in the first of the two lists will receive our
chief attention.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<span class="smcap">Genesis of the Novel of Roman Life</span></h2>

</div>

<p>We have indicated what novels are to be given an important
place in the field of the novel of Roman life; but
before considering so fully developed a form as Bulwer’s
<i>Last Days of Pompeii</i>, let us see what the soil was, from
which such a form grew. Since the novel of Roman life is
a definite variety of the historical novel, we must first consider
the origin of the historical novel as such. The true
historical novel, it has been said, portrays the past with
realistic effect. Since the time of Scott, historical fiction
has in the main followed the example which he set in his
historical novels, and it is largely due to this fact that some
authors have attained notable success in portraying the life
of the past with realistic effect. Before Scott’s time historical
romances existed, often taking such a form as to
point directly toward Scott’s work, and even attaining much
of his success in such a realistic portrayal of life. Yet
in 1785, Clara Reeve had somewhat arbitrarily said: “The
Romance, in lofty and elevated language, describes what
never happened, nor is likely to happen.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This definition
does not seem to allow that the historical romance had
achieved realistic effect at all, and so does not fairly represent
the facts. But it must be remembered that the definition
applied not only to the historical romance, but also to
another form of the romance, which has been called the
“Gothic” romance. While Scott’s work in the historical
novel is, in a sense, a continuation of the historical romance,
the “Gothic” romance better represents the school of fiction
which Scott supplanted. For this reason it seems better to
dispose of the “Gothic” romance before we discuss more
fully the early development of the historical romance.</p>

<p>The “Gothic” romance begins with Horace Walpole’s
<i>Castle of Otranto</i> (1764), which has no real historical background,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
though the events are supposed to have happened
in the twelfth or thirteenth century. Walpole had built a
supposed “Gothic” castle, which he called “Strawberry
Hill,” and the castle became a part of the “Gothic” romance.
Walpole supplied this form of the romance with its familiar
supernatural machinery, its ghost, creaking doors, subterranean
caverns, etc., which need not be described here. It
is well to note, however, at this point, that Scott, who adopted
some of the saner elements of the Gothic romance, used
the supernatural as something inseparable from many of
the real Scotch characters, whom he described. Clara
Reeve’s <i>Champion of Virtue</i> (1777), later called <i>The Old
English Baron</i>, is to be noted, since it contains both Gothic
and historical incidents. The Gothic romance was further
developed by Mrs. Radcliffe, “Monk” Lewis, and others.
Mrs. Radcliffe especially influences Scott and the later novel.
She develops the description of those aspects of nature
which later impressed Byron, and is undoubtedly the creator
of the “Byronic hero.” Her “Schedoni” is in all essentials
Byron’s “Lara,” an individual apart from other men, with
a certain nobility of his own and a “vital scorn of all.” Lord
Byron and his school reproduced certain elements of the
“Gothic” romance, and in turn had an influence on the novel.
The “Byronic hero” and the Byronic passion for the terrible
aspects of nature will appear in the novel of Roman life and
assume a prominent position. The Gothic romance continued
to exist after the time of Mrs. Radcliffe; it took
various forms, such as the detective story and the fantasy,
as well as the tale of terror, with its superstitious elements.
Down to 1850 it remained the fashion for almost
any novelist to arouse his readers from time to time by a
narration of marvelous or terrible events. The Gothic
romance served to show that literature is not merely utilitarian;
even in its wildest forms, it retained certain marks
of the realistic novel, and added testimony to the fact that
realism and romance are, after all, inseparable. While not
making a thorough study of mediæval times, it pointed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
way for Scott, in dealing with this period of the past. It
also had an important effect on the novel of Roman life in
its formative stage, as will be seen.</p>

<p>The so-called “Oriental” romance is really a development
of the Gothic. It originates with the work of William
Beckford in <i>Vathek, an Arabian Tale</i>. This was a consummate
piece of art of its kind, and had a tremendous influence
on the writing of the time. Beckford built in Wiltshire,
an enormous mansion with mysterious halls and galleries,
in which he tried to realize his dreams of Oriental luxury.
<i>Vathek</i> was written in French and published in France in
1787. It was translated from the French manuscript by
Samuel Henley, an English scholar, and published in London
in 1786, without Beckford’s consent. Among other
things, <i>Vathek</i> is noteworthy for its descriptions of Oriental
“magic,” and its employment of what may be called
the “labyrinth motive.” This motive appears in the stories
of all ages, its classic example being the story of the
labyrinth at Crete (which was, perhaps, really a palace).
It is used in some of Scott’s novels (notably <i>Woodstock</i>),
and in many novels of Roman life, in which the characters
have to pass through a series of dark and intricate passages
in the catacombs at Rome, or cut in the rock near some city
of Egypt. The use of Eastern magic is sometimes combined
with this motive and so appears in more than one
novel of Roman life. The influence of <i>Vathek</i> and the “Oriental”
romance, considered apart from other varieties of
the Gothic romance, on the novel of Roman life, is considerable.</p>

<p>The true historical romance is even more important in its
relation to our subject. In tracing its development before
Scott, the first important example is found to be <i>Longsword,
Earl of Salisbury, an Historical Romance</i> (1762), attributed
to the Rev. Thomas Leland, of Dublin. This romance reproduces
feudal scenes such as are found in Shakespeare’s
historical plays, and anticipates many of the elements of
Scott’s historical romances. While the story is told, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
with the detail of an authentic historical document, it
lacks historical perspective. <i>Longsword</i> stood alone for a
time, except for Clara Reeve’s <i>Old English Baron</i> (1777):
this romance of Clara Reeve’s combined historical and
“Gothic” incidents, as already mentioned, and had the effect
of adding historical details to the customary castle and
ghost in the Gothic romance. But in 1783 appeared <i>The
Recess</i>, which is the first of a series of historical romances
down to Scott, and marks a closer approach to the true historical
novel. Its theme is the same as that of <i>Kenilworth</i>;
and may owe something to Shakespeare’s <i>Anthony and Cleopatra</i>,
as <i>Kenilworth</i> does. Many of this series of romances
do, in fact, derive their history from Shakespeare’s historical
dramas. They show an increasing attention to the
facts of history, which culminates in the romances of Jane
Porter. Jane Porter’s imaginative treatment of history far
surpasses any previous attempts. Her <i>Thaddeous of Warsaw</i>
is almost wholly historical, though deficient in characterization
and plot; while in preparing to write <i>The Scottish
Chiefs</i> she actually visited the places which she intended to
describe.</p>

<p>Jane Porter may fairly be given the credit for developing
the use of historical background to a point of perfection,
and so preparing the way for Scott. Moreover, Scott, with
all his romantic imagination, owes something to the
“Gothic” romancers, who preceded him. What, then, did
Scott himself add to the historical novel? Bearing in mind
our definition of the historical novel, two points are to be
considered essential in our answer: He added (1) the
realistic sketch of the manners of the past; (2) characters
who are real beings, who represent human nature. These
two points are suggested by Scott in his General Preface to
the <i>Waverly Novels</i>. It is clear that while he is speaking
of two circumstances which led him to finish <i>Waverly</i>, his
words are to be applied to the whole series of the Waverly
novels. The circumstance which led Scott to undertake to
reproduce faithfully the manners of the past was his completion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
in 1808, of the unfinished romance of the antiquarian,
Joseph Strutt. This romance was called <i>Queen-hoo-Hall</i>,
and described the time of Henry the Sixth; it attempted
to give a “pleasing representation of the manners
and amusements of our forefathers.” (Strutt’s Preface.)
Scott perceived that the reason for its failure was the
author’s “rendering his language too ancient, and displaying
his antiquarian knowledge too liberally”; and resolved
to avoid the mistake “by rendering a similar work more
light and obvious to general comprehension.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Strutt showed
that the historical novelist should attempt an exact reproduction
of the past; but Scott further made it clear that the
manners of the past cannot be reproduced with realistic
effect, if the author relies solely on antiquarian knowledge,
or if he fails to bring his description home to readers of the
present, in terms intelligible to the majority of them.</p>

<p>Of even greater importance to the historical novel was
Scott’s determination to do for the people of Scotland, what
Miss Edgeworth had done for the people of Ireland,—to
bring before his readers real Scotch people of all ranks and
conditions of society, to portray human life in his pages.
Scott is especially a realist when dealing with characters
taken from lowly life; but his realism is not confined to
lowly life alone, as some critics would have us believe. His
great historical figures, it is true, are often given romantic
and literary treatment; but even they do not lack human
touches, and in any case, a proper balance is maintained by
including characters who are human enough. What has
made Scott’s novels deserve to endure is his faithful representation
of human nature. The same thing could be said
of any great historical novel, whether it deals with England
or America a few years back or with the remote times of
ancient Rome. Scott’s plan in writing the historical novel,
was to create imaginary characters, with all the attributes
of real human beings, and to place them in an historical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
background, containing a few historical characters. This
plan, in the main, has been followed by successful historical
novelists since his time,—including those who write of
Roman life,—and seems best adapted to portraying the life
of the past with realistic effect.</p>

<p>It may now be asked when Roman life was first drawn
upon in what may be termed “historical fiction”; whether
any evidence of this is to be found before the period when
Scott set alike the standard and the fashion in that form of
writing. It must be remembered that classic subject-matter
has taken a large place in many forms of English literature,
though it would be out of place to give examples here
taken from other forms of literature than fiction. Not to
mention the very early translations and reworkings of
mediæval legends on classic subjects, it is well to recall that
Chaucer uses classic subject-matter abundantly, and that
his <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> approaches the modern historical
novel in nearly every way, though it is written in verse. If
we are looking for an early presentation of Roman life in a
form leading toward modern prose fiction, we must turn to
the allegorical quasi-historical romances of the seventeenth
century. One of them which may be claimed for England
is the <i>Argenis</i> (1621), of John Barclay. Barclay, who was
born in France, of Scotch father and French mother, lived
for a time in England and finally went to Italy, where he
wrote the <i>Argenis</i> in Latin. It describes important historical
characters of his own time, but under classic names.
Its scenes are placed in classic countries and the story is
told in terms of Roman life and custom. A marriage is performed
in a temple dedicated to Juno and Lucina, high
priests perform the ceremony, and the bridal party honor
Hymen and Apollo. Barclay opened the way for a series
of French romances which were much in vogue in England.
This led to the formation of literary societies, to one of
which Roger Boyle belonged. His <i>Parthenissa</i> (1654), is
another historical allegory, like Barclay’s; it confuses several
great Roman wars, bringing Hannibal and Spartacus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
into the same scene.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Such romances show something of
Roman life in the form of fiction, but are far removed in
some ways from the modern historical novel; and it will be
best for us to return to the time of Scott, and search for a
portrayal of Roman life in the fully developed form of the
historical novel.</p>

<h3 id="II_A">A. THE FIRST TRUE NOVEL OF ROMAN LIFE</h3>

<p>The first significant attempt in English to portray life in
that period of the past during which ancient Rome flourished,
in the form of the modern novel, appears in <i>Valerius, a
Roman Story</i>. It is not to be regarded as a mere coincidence
that its author was John G. Lockhart, a son-in-law of
Sir Walter Scott. The year 1821, in which it was first published,
was also marked by the appearance of <i>Kenilworth</i>
and <i>The Pirate</i>. In <i>Kenilworth</i>, Scott owed much to
Shakespeare’s <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, a play with a classic
subject. And while Scott was showing how the past could
be presented in the novel, it was altogether natural that
Lockhart, a classical scholar, should decide to make use of
classic material in this form. Classic times had furnished
abundant material and true inspiration in other forms of
writing. Though <i>Valerius</i> is not a great novel, it has certain
elements of permanent value. It is a very thorough
and scholarly piece of work, well-balanced and accurate in
detail. Its characters, Christian and pagan, are fairly well-done,
and its scenes represent, with some degree of realism,
the amphitheatre, the crowded streets of Rome, the law-court,
and the suburban villa. While Christianity is not
overemphasized, the martyrdom of Thraso, an old soldier,
who has become a Christian, is described with real pathos.
The story is laid in the time of Trajan, who is justly represented
as a popular ruler, and not a cruel tyrant. The customary
use is made of Pliny’s correspondence with Trajan,
regarding treatment of the Christians. The book is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
without humor, though its general tone is serious and it contains
a little too much philosophy. It was republished in
1835, the year after Bulwer’s <i>Last Days of Pompeii</i>.
<i>Valerius</i> may fairly be considered the first novel of Roman
life. This seems to be implied by Cardinal Newman, who
mentioned it many years later in his preface to <i>Callista</i>.</p>

<h3 id="II_B">B. THE INFLUENCE OF “VATHEK” ON THE NOVEL OF ROMAN LIFE</h3>

<p>In 1827 Thomas Moore published <i>The Epicurean</i>. This
is to be classed as a romance, and is akin to and inspired by
the work of William Beckford in <i>Vathek, an Arabian Tale</i>.
Moore’s <i>The Epicurean</i> takes from <i>Vathek</i> its descriptions
of Egyptian magic, and its use of the “labyrinth motive”;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
these are things which appear in a modified form in Bulwer’s
<i>Last Days of Pompeii</i> (1834). <i>The Epicurean</i>, however,
in spite of its fantastic nature, contains realistic
descriptions of the persecution of the Christians in Africa,
under Diocletian, and a contrast of Christianity with a
pagan system of philosophy (Epicureanism). While its
story does not take the reader to Rome, <i>The Epicurean</i> represents
life in Greece and Egypt under Roman rule, and
must be considered a step in the genesis of the novel of
Roman life. It represents new elements which are not
found in <i>Valerius</i>, but appear frequently in later novels of
Roman life. <i>Vathek</i>, which Moore says was his model, has
been mentioned as an “Oriental” romance, this kind of
romance being a variety of the “Gothic”; and when certain
elements of the “Oriental” romance appear in novels of
Roman life of this early period, it is more logical to ascribe
their existence to the influence of <i>Vathek</i> than to say that
they merely come from <i>The Epicurean</i>. But we have to
consider at this point not only the influence of <i>Vathek</i> as a
thing entirely separate from other literature of the period;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
for the hero of <i>The Epicurean</i> is the “Byronic hero,” already
mentioned in connection with Mrs. Radcliffe and
Byron. The terrible side of nature, which had appealed to
these authors, appears in <i>The Epicurean</i>, combined with
Egyptian “magic”; the hero in passing through the mysteries
of initiation is surrounded by roaring winds and rushing
waters. Thus it appears that <i>The Epicurean</i>, while it
falls far below the first rank,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is important, because it shows
the effect which the Gothic romance, with its various developments,
was having on the early novel of Roman life.</p>

<h3 id="II_C">C. THE INFLUENCE OF THE “BYRONIC ROMANCE” ON THE
NOVEL OF ROMAN LIFE</h3>

<p>In 1829<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> was first published a romance by George Croly,
called <i>Salathiel, a Story of the Past, the Present and the
Future</i>. It enjoyed wide popularity and was favorably reviewed
both in England and America; and was issued at
different times with variations of the title, such as <i>Salathiel,
the Immortal, or the Wandering Jew</i>. Finally it has been
revised and republished posthumously, in 1901, under the
title of <i>Tarry Thou, Till I Come, or Salathiel, the Wandering
Jew</i>. This last edition was published in somewhat elaborate
style with copious introduction and appendix, and
beautifully accurate illustrations, by Mr. T. de Thulstrup.
Especially noteworthy is the introductory letter of General
Lewis Wallace, who, in making his remarkable choice of the
six greatest English novels, includes “<i>Hypatia</i>, and this
romance of Croly’s.” While his choice of the “six greatest”
is unusual, he gives very sound reasons for his support of
<i>Tarry Thou, Till I Come</i>. General Wallace, who is best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
known for his <i>Ben Hur</i>, also wrote <i>The Prince of India</i>, in
which he handles the theme of the Wandering Jew, describing
the wanderings of the Jew in Moslem times.</p>

<p>Croly was born in 1780 in Dublin and died in 1860. In
<i>Salathiel</i> he follows the school of Byron and Moore, which
was dominant in his youth. The style of the book is marked
by a warmth of coloring, and Croly excels in his handling
of powerful situations. The character of Salathiel, surrounded
by perpetual gloom, and displaying a proud aloofness
from other men, has much in it of the “Byronic hero.”
The terrible aspects of nature are also presented with telling
effect, and much in the Byronic manner throughout the
story; Croly is at his best in this sort of work in a chapter,
which has been given the title <i>The Wanderings of a Mind
Diseased</i>, and which represents the reality of Salathiel’s
imaginary trials. In this chapter the description of a volcanic
eruption suggests a similar description made by Bulwer
in <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i>, a few years later. The
scene of <i>Salathiel</i> does not open in Rome, but from the very
start, the reader feels the intensity of the Jewish hatred for
Roman power. The degenerate Roman governor of Judea,
Gessius Florus, is well portrayed in his capacity of extortioner
and tyrant. He sends Salathiel to Rome, and at this
point in the story we are given in a brief space many of the
important elements in any novel of Roman life which deals
with the time of Nero. There is the prisoner, calmly condemned
to a death of torture, while the Emperor feigns
practice on the lyre; then the fire at Rome is powerfully
described, and when it is over, the blame for it is attached
to the Christians; the Christians are put to death by torture
in the amphitheatre, or torn by wild beasts; they are made
to serve as living torches in Nero’s gardens; and finally the
persecution ceases. Though his name is not mentioned,
the martyrdom of St. Paul is told in such a way as to portray
his indomitable spirit and courage in the face of death.</p>

<p>The scene of the remainder of the story is again laid in
Judea, and the story of events culminating in the capture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
of Jerusalem by a Roman army, is taken from Josephus.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
In this part of the book things Roman are best represented
by the figure of the Prince and commander, Titus, and by
the soldiers and officers of the Roman army. The divisions
of the Roman army are described with great realism, recruited
as they are from almost every tribe and nation
under the sun. The fierce struggles between Roman and
Jew outside of the walls, give opportunity for some of the
finest pictures of desperate fighting to be found in any novel.
The “labyrinth motive,” one of the oldest motives in story
telling, is used a number of times in the latter part of
<i>Salathiel</i>; it is used with much ingenuity in the description
of his entrance into the fortress of Masada by a secret underground
passage; and again, when, escaping from prison,
he finds he has blundered upon the secret rear entrance of
the pirates’ cave.</p>

<p><i>Salathiel</i> is a truly great romance, in which the exalted
language is suited to the grandeur of the theme. While
“romance” is the proper word to describe the book as a
whole, individual passages exhibit a realistic effect which
far surpasses anything in the pages of <i>Valerius</i> or of <i>The
Epicurean</i>. Moreover, it is sound in its historical basis,
for Croly was a man of genuine learning, classic<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and otherwise.
On the other hand, it must not be supposed, because
he was a curate, that he wrote <i>Salathiel</i> with any intention
of spreading religious propaganda. The scene in which the
Christians, imprisoned and awaiting crucifixion, exhibit
their supreme faith, is one of tremendous significance; but
this could be said of many other scenes in the book. Even
if it were not a story of absorbing interest, <i>Salathiel</i> would
deserve a high position in fiction, for its illustration of great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
principles in life, and its powerful revelation of eternal
truths.</p>

<h3 id="II_D">D. THE NOVEL OF ROMAN LIFE IN A FULLY DEVELOPED FORM</h3>

<p>In 1834 was published Bulwer’s<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <i>Last Days of Pompeii</i>,
which probably has been as widely read, and for as long a
period as any other historical novel. Men still live who consider
Bulwer among the greatest of English novelists; and
if one were to select only one book for which he is especially
remembered, I believe The <i>Last Days of Pompeii</i> would have
equal claims with such a novel as <i>The Last of the Barons</i>,
to which critics usually assign a higher place. <i>The Last
Days of Pompeii</i> was a new thing of its kind; it represents
a new departure in the historical novel, and in the novel of
Roman life. It is true that there remain in it certain elements
of the Byronism, which was still so prevalent in the
novel of the day, but these elements cannot merely be dismissed
as defects. There is the Byronic passion for the
terrible in nature, which reaches its height in the unsurpassed
description of the eruption of Vesuvius, and its terrible
effects. The “Byronic hero,” moreover, can easily be
seen in the disguise of Arbaces, the Egyptian, who is surrounded
by an air of mystery, and has a lofty scorn of the
common herd of mankind. Moreover, Arbaces, to secure
his ends, has recourse to Egyptian “magic,” the intricacy
and subtlety of which had been well represented in <i>The Epicurean</i>.
Such motives as these, however, have already been
discussed, together with their relation to the novel of Roman
life. Let us see what Bulwer added to this particular
variety of the historical novel.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that Scott (who must be considered
Bulwer’s most important predecessor in the field), in writing
his historical novels, always made use of historical characters
and events, as well as of purely imaginary characters
and events. Bulwer departed from this program, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
first instance, by reducing the number of historical events,—the
eruption being the only important one. Moreover, he
succeeded, with no loss of effect, in replacing the “historical”
characters, which are usually necessary to the historical
novel, by imaginary characters such as he perceived
would be in harmony with the time he described. This
omission of “historical” characters is to be accounted for by
Bulwer’s choice of scene. Having chosen Pompeii (and not
Rome) for his scene, and finding there were no “historical”
characters suitable for a novel portraying the life of this
brilliant Campanian city, he decided to make up for their
absence by lending an almost “historical” reality to his
imaginary characters. Scott had made his imaginary characters
appear to be real men and women by reproducing
real men and women whom he had observed; Bulwer, in
writing The <i>Last Days of Pompeii</i>, undertook the more difficult
task of representing men and women who might well
have lived in the times of ancient Rome,—and succeeds
rather well. Around these characters he decided to weave
a narrative which would reproduce exactly the life of the
time,—and in this he succeeds admirably. Scott had been
warned by the mistake made by the antiquary, Joseph
Strutt, in a misuse of antiquarian details. Bulwer was an
antiquarian of an entirely different sort; he revelled in the
use of details, but in putting them into his story, made the
whole conduce toward realistic effect. He had read widely in
Latin and Greek literature; he climbed Mt. Vesuvius and
learned all he could by actual observation, filing every detail
in huge commonplace books; he studied Roman antiquities,
and compared the results of his study with the manners of
modern Italians. In short, he realized in his imagination
the decadent life of Pompeii as it had actually been just
before the eruption of Vesuvius, and reproduced it in the
pages of The <i>Last Days of Pompeii</i>. While Bulwer, therefore,
did not reproduce historical characters and events in
quite the same way that Scott did, he makes an even more
concrete use, than Scott did, of that life of the past which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
is not recorded in formal history. He views the past from
the standpoint of the philosopher as well as from that of
the student of human nature. Moreover, he seeks for permanent
truths in human nature, rather than for merely
picturesque elements.</p>

<p>The title and subject of <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i>, was
first concretely suggested to Bulwer’s mind by a picture of
the same title. This picture, he says in his journal, was
one of a collection in the Brera Gallery at Milan, and was
“full of genius, imagination and nature. The faces are fine,
the conception grand.” And as the author says in his
Preface to the 1834 Edition, having chosen for his subject
the “catastrophe, the Destruction of Pompeii, it required
but little insight into the higher principles of art to perceive
that to Pompeii the story should rigidly be confined.
Placed in contrast with the mighty pomp of Rome, the luxuries
and gaud of the vivid Campanian city would have sunk
into insignificance. Her awful fate would have seemed but
a petty and isolated wreck in the vast seas of the imperial
sway.” Bulwer therefore decided to avoid the temptation
“to conduct the characters of his tale ... from
Pompeii to Rome,” leaving “to others the honor of
delineating the hollow but majestic civilization of Rome.”
The last part of this quotation is especially important to us.
Bulwer in his preparatory studies spent much time in Rome,
as well as in the vicinity of Pompeii. While the story of
The Last Days of Pompeii does not actually go to Rome, all
of its important elements, save the description of the eruption,
could be transferred to a story of the Imperial City.
Thus Bulwer’s novel not only shows that the novel of Roman
life had become firmly established as a definite type, but it
also points forward and shows the way for all important
novels of Roman life since its time. The mingling of
Romans and Italians, with Greeks and other foreigners in
Pompeii, suggests the hybrid population of Rome; the worship
of Isis, and her priest, the Egyptian Arbaces, suggest
not only the varied forms of pagan religion at Rome, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
also the important connections of Rome with Alexandria
and the Nile civilization; the early struggles of Christianity
(represented by Olinthus, and his converts) with these
pagan superstitions recall the even greater trials of the
Christians at Rome; the witch of the crater, with her spells
and incantations, reminds one of the Sibyl of Cumæ and
the soothsayers who appear at Rome in later novels of
Roman life. The minor incidents of Bulwer’s novel and his
descriptions of the manners of society also are used in
novels whose scene is Rome; the banquets and revels, the
life of loungers at the bath and spectators at the amphitheatre,
the habits and haunts of the gladiators, the busy
hum of the forum, are all things which Bulwer showed later
novelists how to portray. He realized that he must not
make his characters talk in the periods of Cicero, and takes
without question the opinion of Scott (voiced in the preface
to <i>Ivanhoe</i>), that the historical novelist should “explain
ancient manners in modern language.” Bulwer’s method
was somewhat different from that of Scott; but his purpose
was essentially the same. His ideal is fairly stated at the
end of the Preface to the 1834 edition, viz., to present a portrait
faithful “to the features and costume of the age which
I have attempted to paint. May it be (what is far more important)
a just representation of the human passions and
the human heart, whose elements in all ages are the same.”
How well he achieved his purpose and realized his ideal is
amply shown in The <i>Last Days of Pompeii</i>. Writers of the
novel of Roman life who have followed Bulwer have surpassed
him in few respects. Their purpose must be essentially
the same as his; their ideal could not be higher.</p>

<p>Before the close of the year 1834, <i>Valerius</i> and <i>The Last
Days of Pompeii</i> are the only two important novels whose
scene is laid almost entirely in or near ancient Rome.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
fact is attested by historians of the novel; but if one is not
satisfied without hearing an opinion of an author’s work
expressed by one of his contemporaries, we have the tribute
of Sir Archibald Alison (<i>History of Europe</i>, 1815-52, ch.
V). He says in speaking of <i>Valerius</i>, “The most successful
attempt which has yet been made to engraft the interest of
modern life on ancient story: its extreme difficulty may be
judged by the brilliant genius of Bulwer having alone rivalled
him in the undertaking.” If there is any other book
written before 1834, which deserves in every respect the
title of “novel of Roman life,” I have been unable to trace
it, nor do I know of any one else who claims to have done
so. In considering the genesis of the novel of Roman
life, one may be confident that <i>Valerius</i> first marks out its
general outlines, and <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i> establishes
for it a complete and artistic form.</p>

<span class="smcap">Principal Lines of Development of the Novel of
Roman Life from 1834 to the Present Day</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In considering the principal lines of development which
the novel of Roman life has followed in its development
from the time of Bulwer’s novel to the present day, one fact
seems fairly obvious, but cannot be overemphasized. No
important novel of Roman life has been written by an
author who lacks classical scholarship of a very high order.
Needless to say, such scholarship implies the possession of
a highly cultivated intellect, and stands far above mere
book-learning or pedanticism. In a general survey of the
field it very soon appears that scholarship of this kind was
possessed by the great scholar and preacher, Charles Kingsley,
and is finely exemplified in his <i>Hypatia</i>, in spite of what
pedantic critics have said concerning his “history.” After
Kingsley, other great scholars, who were also preachers,
made the novel of Roman life a vehicle for the presentation
of universal truths. Besides such preachers, Ebers, Eckstein,
and other followers of Scott in Germany,—whose classic
novels constitute the most important influence from abroad
on the English novel of Roman life before the time of <i>Quo
Vadis</i> (1896),—showed the value of absolute thoroughness
in matters of scholarship. While they sometimes were led
in their careful research to place undue emphasis on minute
particulars, they often succeeded in giving to their work
an atmosphere of universal truth. Novelists, whose principal
purpose seems to have been to tell a “rattling good
story” or to present a series of gorgeous pictures of Roman
life, soon came to realize the necessity of scholarly accuracy,
if they would attain to realistic effect. This was true of
Whyte-Melville, the author of <i>The Gladiators</i> (1863), and
of General Lew Wallace, who wrote <i>Ben Hur</i> (1880),
though it must be admitted that the latter was somewhat
more of a scholar, and had a more serious purpose. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
success of men who have made a business of scholarship
speaks for itself in the more recent and really fine work of
Mr. William Stearns Davis in <i>A Friend of Caesar</i> (1900),
and of Mr. Edward Lucas White in <i>Andivius Hedulio</i>
(1921). But the finest fruits of the true scholarly mind
have ever pointed toward the intellectual, the æsthetic, the
beautiful in thought and expression. The beauty of thought
and expression of Walter Pater’s <i>Marius, the Epicurean</i>
(1885), has perhaps never been surpassed in English prose
fiction. Some approach to the quality of Pater’s work,
however, is seen in that of George Gissing, in <i>Veranilda</i>
(1904), and an even greater similarity to it appears in parts
of <i>Pan and the Twins</i> (1922), by Mr. Eden Philpotts. Novelists
such as these seek not merely to portray life as it
appears to the average observer, but to make possible a fine
appreciation of many things, which exist only for those who
are seeking truth and beauty beneath the surface.</p>

<h3 id="III_A">A. NOVELS OF ROMAN LIFE WHICH SHOW EVIDENCE OF THE
SCHOLARSHIP OF GREAT PREACHERS</h3>

<p>Let us consider first that phase of the development of the
novel of Roman life, which is seen in novels showing unmistakable
evidence of the scholarship of great preachers. A
significant proportion of the limited list of the best novels
of Roman life previously given consists of novels written by
preachers. Now in defining the novel of Roman life, those
books were excluded, which make use of Roman life merely
as an artificial background for religious instruction. But
it would certainly be a needless restriction to deny to the
novel of Roman life, or indeed to any form of the historical
novel, the liberty to present, directly or indirectly, any valuable
sort of teaching. It is impossible truly to portray the
life of ancient Rome, without teaching many things of lasting
value. Moreover, there is a grave error in supposing
that those important novels of Roman life which are written
by preachers have as their sole purpose the preaching of
Christianity; nor do they endeavor to portray the life of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Christians alone, and to deny a fair representation to the
Pagan life which all but overwhelmed Christianity. A
fairer statement of the case would be to say that preachers
of scholarly attainments have been eminently fitted to write
of Roman life through their study of that period of the
world’s history, which is marked by the formation of the
Roman Empire and the beginning of Christianity. Consequently
they have produced novels in which the life of the
early Christians appears naturally as an essential part of
the life of ancient Rome. To include the life of the Christians
in the novel of Roman life is not absolutely necessary,
though all of our preacher-authors have done so; but it is
more natural to do so in a novel, the story of which is laid
after the time of Christ, and nearly all authors of such
novels have appeared to recognize this. Finally the scholarly
preacher has proven to be the best qualified of all men
not only to present something of the dramatic struggle
between Christianity and the pagan world; but also to portray
the life of Rome in such a way as to bring home to his
readers universal truths far above the level of mere didacticism.
Unless such truths are sensed and illustrated by an
author, no portrayal of the past can attain to an entire completeness
of realistic effect.</p>

<p>The first significant novel of Roman life by such an
author, was the work of the Rev. William Ware, a Unitarian
preacher of Boston, and thorough classical scholar. In
1837, three years after <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i> appeared,
he published <i>Zenobia, or The Fall of Palmyra</i>. Ware was
no doubt led to write a novel of Roman times by the work
of Bulwer and other novelists of the British Isles, who had
done so; though in his work there is none of the Byronism
which had appeared in the work of Croly, the only other
preacher whose novel has been discussed so far in this
study. Just what influenced Ware in his choice of title and
subject is not quite so clear. As far back as 1814 there had
been published in London a work by a certain Miss O’Keefe,
entitled <i>Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, a Narrative founded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
on History</i>. This combines slow-moving dialogue with narration
of the style of a school history book, and can hardly
be classed as a genuine novel. While it is fairly accurate
in its history, it does not appear to be of sufficient merit to
have influenced Ware in his far superior work, even if he
knew of it. A much more likely supposition is that Ware
was first attracted in the course of his reading by the life-story
of the famous queen who dared to lead her army
against the hosts of the Roman empire; he then found
further encouragement to write the novel from the popularity
of historical fiction and from his familiarity with the
sources from which the facts of Zenobia’s story are readily
derived. In any case, <i>Zenobia</i>, among novels so far considered,
(when published) had been equaled only by Croly’s
<i>Salathiel</i> in the accurate and abundant use of historical
facts derived from original historical sources. Pollio, the
biographer of Zenobia, Vopiscus, the biographer of Aurelian,
and other historians, are accurately quoted to establish
important points; and when there is evidence on both sides
of a question, Ware weighs it very carefully. On the other
hand, he does not make the mistake of crowding his pages
with notes. These are condensed within the space of a few
pages at the end of each of the two volumes.</p>

<p><i>Zenobia</i> is written in the letters of L. Manlius Piso, an
imaginary personage who is supposed to have been in Palmyra
at the time of its fall, and who writes to a friend at
Rome. Since the first letter describes to his friend how
he left Rome, the scene may be said to open at Rome, and
it returns to Rome when Zenobia has been made a captive
by Aurelian. Moreover, the character of Piso is distinctly
Roman, and the cruel, stern emperor, Aurelian, appears as
a true Roman. The military operations of the Romans
before the walls of Palmyra, and the Emperor’s triumph at
Rome with Zenobia as his captive, are well described. There
is thus much of Roman life in <i>Zenobia</i>. Its so-called “epistolary”
or “Richardsonian” style, is heavily descriptive, but
the general effect is one of soundness, and the novel is impressive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
not dull. In fact, <i>Zenobia</i> possesses a brightness
of coloring and an atmosphere of reality which seem superior
to anything in Ware’s later books. While the minor
characters do not stand out strongly, they are nevertheless
real and human enough. Any deficiencies shown by the
other characters are atoned for in Ware’s presentation of
Zenobia, whom the author successfully portrays as a real
woman and a proud queen. Ware is also true to history in
recording that Zenobia had heard much of Christianity, but
did not finally decide to become a Christian. Though a
preacher, he preferred to state the probable truth, rather
than to change the facts for the sake of preaching. In this
he points the way for other preacher-authors who followed
him in writing the novel of Roman life. <i>Zenobia</i> was
widely read on its first publication and attained equal success
when it was posthumously published in 1869.</p>

<p>The success of <i>Zenobia</i> led its author to publish a sequel
in the following year, 1838. This was called <i>Aurelian,
Emperor of Rome</i>, when it was republished shortly afterward,
and goes by that title, though its original title was
<i>Probus</i>. The scene of this novel is laid entirely in Rome,
and the supposed narrator speaks as though he had survived
Aurelian, had seen something of the persecution of Diocletian,
and finally enjoyed safety under Constantine. Like
<i>Zenobia</i>, <i>Aurelian</i> is written in the form of letters; these
letters are supposed to have been collected by a freedman
of one of the characters. While it contains the story of a
conversion to Christianity, <i>Aurelian</i> is not to be classed as
propaganda of any sort. Whatever preaching there is in
it consists merely of a realistic portrayal of the sufferings
of the Christians under persecution. The scenes in which
Christians are submitted to various forms of torture are by
no means overdrawn, and the martyrdom of some of them
in the arena is described in a convincing manner. Over-emphasis
on the place of Christianity in Roman life is to
some extent avoided by making the Emperor a more important
figure than any one of the Christians. <i>Aurelian</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
is a book of one important character, the Emperor being the
dominant figure. Ware’s second novel may truly be called
a novel of Roman life, since it portrays faithfully some
aspects of life at Rome in the time of Aurelian. But even
in these terrible times there were other things in the life of
Rome than the persecution of the Christians; and a more
complete effect would have been obtained by including some
of these in the picture. The fault is not overemphasis of
one element so much as the omission of others. The author
was careful in his study of life at Rome, but limited that
study too much to a single phase of Roman life. One of his
contemporaries, Miss Mitford, in her <i>Literary Recollections</i>,
said of <i>Aurelian</i>, that it showed “not a trace of modern
habits or modes of thinking;” but this is a purely negative
compliment. The novel does portray something of ancient
Roman habits and modes of thinking; its psychology is good
in the case of the Christians and their persecutors. While
not making quite the same use of the larger facts of history
as appears in <i>Zenobia</i>, Ware showed his scholarship in
<i>Aurelian</i> especially well in his minutely detailed description
of the Roman system of espionage, and of the traits of character
which were exhibited in the Roman masters of the
world. Though its tone is too sinister for present-day taste,
<i>Aurelian</i> made a great impression in its day, and takes an
important place in the development of the novel of Roman
life.</p>

<p>Ware’s third novel, published in 1841, was called <i>Julian;
Scenes in Judea</i>. This is also written in the form of letters;
and the story is told in the words of a wealthy young Jew,
who leaves Rome, where he has been staying, and returns
to his native land. <i>Julian</i> can hardly be called a novel of
Roman life, since, as the alternative title implies, most of
the action takes place in Judea; and it excels rather in its
portrayal of the Jewish national life, than in its description
of the Romans. A fine conception, however, of the grandeur
and extent of the Roman Empire is afforded by the description
of the travels of the young Jew. Realistic touches are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
added in pictures of the stately buildings of Asiatic cities
and of wild animals, which are being shipped for the games
in the arena. Furthermore the delineation of the Roman
governor Pilate and of Roman soldiers in Judea is made
with masterful strokes. But the significant thing in <i>Julian</i>
in relation to the development of the novel of Roman life,
is that it is the first novel approaching that type, which has
for its central theme the life-story of Jesus Christ. Though
it is beyond the power of any novelist to tell this story with
one-half the power of the inspired narrative of the New
Testament, even when feebly retold, it is of such tremendous
meaning, that any portrayal of Roman life made in connection
with it is sure to pale into insignificance. <i>Julian</i> proved
conclusively that a novel which is intended primarily to
portray Roman life, cannot make the life of Christ its central
theme. The Rev. Mr. Ware’s three novels were not
only very popular in America and in England, but were
translated into German and other foreign languages. They
were very favorably received by contemporary critics. In
reviewing <i>Julian</i>, shortly after it appeared, Dr. R. W. Griswold
says, “The romances of Mr. Ware betray a familiarity
with the civilization of the ancients, and are written in a
graceful, pure, and brilliant style.” No novel in America
surpasses the novels of Ware in their importance in the
development of the novel of Roman life before the publication
of Gen. Lew Wallace’s <i>Ben Hur</i> (1880).</p>

<p>The Rev. Ware’s <i>Julian</i> has just been mentioned as an
illustration of the fact that no novel, whether written by a
preacher or not, can successfully portray Roman life, while
making the life of Christ its central theme. <i>Aurelian</i> was
also spoken of, to illustrate the more general truth that in
a portrayal of Roman life in a novel, the life of the Christians
should not be given undue prominence. Mrs. Webb’s
<i>Naomi</i> (1841),<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is a story which begins immediately after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the time of Christ, but much of the life of Christ is brought
in by the words of the aged Mary of Bethany and others
of His disciples who are still living. Moreover, the life of
the Christians, as contrasted with that of the Romans, is
given undue prominence. <i>Naomi</i> has, in fact, been mentioned
in the first section of this study, and was excluded
from consideration as a novel of Roman life, since it is
rather a story of religious experience. It is now mentioned
again to remind one that it is the first important one of a
very great number of religious books that were written
from this time on. In other words, the year 1841 marks,
as nearly as possible, the exact point at which the story of
religious instruction branches off and becomes an entirely
different thing from the novel of Roman life. The Rev.
Ware’s <i>Julian</i> and <i>Aurelian</i> are not in any sense stories of
religious instruction, but they suggested to other preachers
and people interested in religious work the possibility of
writing such stories. Thus the story of religious instruction
was a by-product of the early novel of Roman life; but
it continued to exist as a distinct form, and to have an influence
in turn on the development of the novel of Roman life.
It is important to bear this influence in mind, even though
the story of religious instruction showed not so much what
the novel of Roman life should do, as what it should avoid.</p>

<p>In 1853<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> appeared Charles Kingsley’s <i>Hypatia</i>. This is
a great novel, which in its presentation of universal truths
far surpasses the stereotyped instruction of any religious
tract. It is a powerful picture of the conflict between
Christianity and Greek philosophy in the fifth century. Its
author fairly presents the beauty of Greek philosophy, before
showing that the true spirit of Christianity must
triumph in the end. But Kingsley also showed the essential
falsity of the teachings of the Greek schools of philosophy,
which his heroine, Hypatia, represented; and he pointed
out in an equally convincing way, that the Christian Church,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
while almost entirely shutting out spiritual Christianity,
had become an organization, whose chief end was temporal
power. By considering this last fact outside of its proper
relation, Kingsley’s enemies were enabled to wilfully misunderstand
him, although those who still read <i>Hypatia</i> for
its own sake are always able to understand him perfectly.
In fact, the reasons which led Kingsley to write <i>Hypatia</i>,
have frequently been misstated. It will be well to consider
what the facts were, especially since they have an important
bearing on the development of the novel of Roman life.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><i>Hypatia</i> is, in the words of William T. Brewster, Professor
of English at Columbia University, “a very decided
sermon in favor of spiritual Christianity.” This explains
in part Kingsley’s purpose in his portrayal of life in the
Roman empire of the fifth century. Let it be said right
here, however, that while <i>Hypatia</i> contains more preaching
than any other novel we have to consider, it is entirely free
from hollow didacticism. As its alternative title, <i>New Foes
with an Old Face</i>, implies, Kingsley was supporting the
cause of spiritual Christianity against new elements, which
were assailing Christianity in the same way in which it has
always been assailed. One of the most powerful of these
elements, at the time when Kingsley wrote, was deemed to
be the false Hellenism which was then trying to supplant
Christianity in England and on the continent. This form
of paganism has no uncertain connection with the Byronism,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
of which we have already spoken, while its tendency to
exalt Greek philosophy had been beautifully expressed in
Schiller’s poem <i>The Gods of Greece</i>. Kingsley’s desire to
combat this tendency may be the principal reason why he
chose for his scene Alexandria; since in this city was best
represented the crisis of the dramatic struggle between
Christianity and Greek civilization in the fifth century. But
another important element which Kingsley was fighting,—(and
critics have made the mistake of supposing it to be the
only one),—is represented in the tendency of the Church of
England toward Rome. This movement was chiefly due to
John Henry Newman, who went over to the Church of
Rome, and whose <i>Callista</i> we shall have occasion to mention
later. But it is interesting to us to note that the conspiracy
to Romanize the Church of England, which Kingsley combatted,
centred at Oxford; and, as has since been pointed
out by literary criticism, the Oxford movement was an evidence
of the Romantic spirit represented by Scott. For,
long before Newman went over to Rome, Scott’s mediæval
priest had gained the sympathy of countless English readers.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
Thus Kingsley, who is a direct follower of Scott in
the historical romance, was forced to combat the tendency
of Scott’s readers to identify romance and mediæval Catholicism.
G. P. R. James, an earlier follower of Scott, though
anything but a propagandist, had spoken of Rome in <i>Attila</i>,
(1837), as the “seat of the most autocratic government the
world has ever seen, republican, imperial and <i>clerical</i>.”
These words contain whole volumes of criticism, and show
how another writer of the novel of Roman life had identified
the city of Rome with the Church of Rome. This suggests
another reason why Kingsley chose Alexandria, rather
than Rome, for the scene of his portrayal of the struggle
between Christianity and Paganism, in <i>Hypatia</i>. Had he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
merely wished to portray this struggle, he might well have
laid his scene in Imperial Rome, as others have done, and
have achieved tremendous effect. But his opponents would
have insisted on identifying the early Church <i>at</i> Rome with
the Church <i>of</i> Rome, and the situation at the time forbade
his allowing them the satisfaction of claiming that the
triumph of Christianity is to be found only in “the Eternal
Church of Rome.” In <i>Hypatia</i> Kingsley in no way exceeds
the limits of truth in his delineation of the faults and
hypocrisy of the early Church, though his opponents could
not stand the truth told of what they conceived to be an
eternal and perfect thing, (the Catholic Church). His
faithful presentation of life in the Roman empire, and of
universal truths to be derived from a study of the past,
make <i>Hypatia</i> continue to be read as a great novel which
has to be considered as a thing far above sectarian controversy.</p>

<p>Kingsley’s own idea of what he wished to do in <i>Hypatia</i>
is admirably expressed in a letter to the Rev. F. D. Maurice,
written from Eversley, January 16, 1851. (He writes of
financial difficulties, which compel him to support himself
with his pen,—how this recalls Scott!) He then says: “My
present notion is to write a historical romance of the beginning
of the fifth century which has been breeding in my
head this two years.... If there is a storm brewing,
of course I shall have to help to fight the Philistines....
My idea in the romance is to set forth Christianity as the
only really democratic creed, and philosophy, above all spiritualism,
as the most exclusively aristocratic creed. Such
has been my opinion for a long time, and what I have been
reading lately confirms it more and more. Even Synesius,
‘the philosophic’ bishop, is an aristocrat by the side of Cyril.
It seems to me that such a book might do good just now,
while the scribes and Pharisees, Christian and heathen, are
saying, this people which knoweth not the law is accursed.”
He wished to turn from English subjects “to some new
field, in which there is richer and more picturesque life....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
I have long wished to do something antique, and get
out my thoughts about the connection of the old world and
the new; Schiller’s <i>Gods of Greece</i> expresses, I think, a tone
of feeling very common, and which finds its vent in modern
Neo-Platonism—Anythingarianism.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Kingsley wished to
show “the connection of the old and new” in important
phases of life and thought; and incidentally that in any
portrayal of life, thought must be considered an essential
part of life. He succeeded admirably in this, in writing
<i>Hypatia</i>.</p>

<p>In his desire to “show the connection of old and new,”
and to portray “a richer and more picturesque life,” Kingsley
naturally turned to the times of the Roman Empire.
Why he did not select the city of Rome for his scene, has
already been suggested. Nevertheless, <i>Hypatia</i> may well
be called a novel of Roman life. In the first place the scene
practically does move to Rome, when we follow Raphael
Aben-Ezra in his travels to the immediate vicinity of the
eternal city. In the scenes leading up to the defeat of
Count Heraclian at Ostia, Rome’s seaport, the presence of
the capital of the world is felt in the background. Moreover,
the scene of the rest of the story is not confined to
Alexandria, but takes one to visit Saint Augustine and
Synesius at Cyrene. The allusions to the powerful position
which Constantinople had assumed in Church and government
affairs completes the impression of the Roman
empire as a loosely organized whole. A further consideration
shows one that the important scenes which occur in
Alexandria could, without difficulty, be transferred to Rome,
and described as a part of Roman life. The brutal and
licentious spectacles in the amphitheatre, the ostentatious
display of the upper classes, the lawless rioting of the lower
classes, who are sometimes curbed by Roman authority with
unnecessary bloodshed, and much else, are portrayed with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
realistic effect, which could hardly be surpassed in a portrayal
of life anywhere else than in Rome itself. In the
time which <i>Hypatia</i> describes, it is true, Rome was no
longer mistress of the world, but there remains an all-pervading
sense of her former greatness. Alexandria,
though a city possessing its own distinctive characteristics,
had not escaped the universal stamp of Roman influence.
A few short years before Kingsley’s story opens, the Goths,
under Alaric, had sacked Rome, (410 A. D.), and Alexandria
furnishes in some ways a better example of the many-sided
life of the declining Roman empire than does Rome itself.
There is, in short, an abundance of “Roman life” in Alexandria.</p>

<p>If Alexandrian scenes in <i>Hypatia</i> could be transferred to
Rome, a similar thing might be said of certain characters in
the book. The most truly Roman characters are Victoria
and her father, who had been a Roman officer in the force
of Heraclian; these enter the story when its scene is nearest
to Rome. The armed forces of the weak Roman government
at Alexandria are also typical of Rome, whether performing
as gladiators in the amphitheatre, or employed in
quelling a riot in the streets with brutal carelessness of life
and feeling. Orestes, the Roman governor of Alexandria,
is a typical Roman official, capable of thinking for himself
when not intoxicated, and bright enough to admit that he is
forced to be a puppet; “a poor, miserable slave of a governor,”
who appears to feel that his very treachery is forced
on him by circumstance. Old Miriam is a sorceress of a
type which suggests the sibyls and later soothsayers at
Rome, by whose arts the Romans were so ready to be
deceived, and whose prophecies exerted so profound an
influence on the imaginations of the Romans. One of her
victims is Hypatia, whose character stands out with such
strong individuality as the last support of Greek philosophy
in Alexandria, that it would be impossible to make her play
her part in a novel whose scene was laid principally in
Rome. But many of the other characters, major and minor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
could be placed in such a novel without disadvantage; indeed
some of them have spent a good part of their lives in
Rome, when the story opens. Figures such as Arsenius
and St. Augustine represent men who had seen the world
of Rome, and were seeking refuge from its emptiness. The
tyrannical bishop Cyril embodies a character which could
have displayed the autocratic power of the Church at Rome
or at any other important city of the Empire. Philammon,
the real hero of the story, is the kind of character who
would fit in readily in any environment and could easily be
made a Roman. He is the best illustration of a fact we
have mentioned before, viz., that the historical novel should
contain characters who are, above all, human beings. Philammon’s
essentially human qualities gain the reader’s sympathy
at once; and as he is tempted by one doubt after
another, one is reminded that the men of the past were
merely human beings like ourselves. Among the Gothic
invaders of the Roman Empire, old Wulf best represents
those qualities which Englishmen have regarded with pride
as being typical of the English race. Pelagia is a type
which existed at Rome as at Alexandria. The same thing
can be said of the little porter, and of all the minor characters.
With characters such as these playing their parts
in scenes of varying significance, Kingsley has presented a
vivid panorama of the life of the time, which could only
have been equalled by a portrayal of the life of Rome itself.
Without an excess of detail or an undue use of the sensational,
he has succeeded in emphasizing the important points
in the picture, and in implying those of less importance, so
well, that the life of the past is made to stand out in the
clear light of present-day experience.</p>

<p>By portraying the life of the past in the light of universal
truth. Kingsley was able to show, without stereotyped
preaching, the triumph of Christianity over paganism.
Greek philosophy had been appropriated by and identified
with the so-called “national” religion of Rome, and had
found its greatest stronghold in the Hellenistic city of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Alexandria. Hypatia herself deserves to have her name
made the title of Kingsley’s novel. She is rightly presented
as typifying the last adherent of paganism against Christianity.
The strength of her character lies in the truth of
her words, as compared with the inconsistencies of the
monks. And it is to be regarded as an essential point in
the story, that the savage monks, who represent sham
Christianity, merely destroy the body of Hypatia, and
have not even attempted to win over her soul. At the time
when Philammon first meets Hypatia, her faith in herself
and her message is supreme and unshaken. Kingsley’s own
words, describing the first impression she makes upon the
young monk, show the germs of real truth and beauty,
which that message contains, in spite of any inconsistencies:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>So beautiful! So calm and merciful to him! So enthusiastic towards all
which was noble! Had not she too spoken of the unseen world, of the hope
of immortality, of the conquest of the spirit over the flesh, just as a Christian
might have done? Was the gulf between them so infinite? If so, why
had her aspirations awakened echoes in his own heart,—echoes, too, just such
as the prayers and lessons of the Laura used to awaken? If the fruit was
so like, must not the root be like also?—Could that be a counterfeit? That
a minister of Satan in the robes of an angel of light? Light at least it was:
purity, simplicity, courage, earnestness, tenderness, flashed out from eye, lip,
gesture....</p>

</div>

<p>The essence of sham Christianity, which pervaded all
parts of the later Empire, and was not confined to the great
cities of Rome and Alexandria, is shown by contrast in the
description of the impression the monks had made upon the
young Philammon:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The men were coarse, fierce, noisy, so different from her! Their talk
seemed mere gossip,—scandalous too, and hard judging most of it; about that
man’s private ambition, and that woman’s proud looks; and who had stayed
for the Eucharist the Sunday before, and who had gone out after the sermon;
and how the majority who did not stay, could possibly dare to go, and how
the minority who did not go could possibly dare to stay.... Endless
suspicions, sneers, complaints ... what did they care for the eternal
glories and the beatific vision? Their one test for all men and things, from
the patriarch to the prefect, seemed to be,—did he or it advance the cause
of the Church?—which Philammon soon discovered to mean their own cause,
their influence, their self-glorification.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>Criticism such as this the Church of Rome in Kingsley’s
day took to itself, and resented. But Kingsley’s criticism
was directed against sham Christianity, wherever it existed,
(not solely against the Church of Rome). Moreover,
<i>Hypatia</i> is not so much <i>against</i> sham Christianity as <i>for</i>
true Christianity. Let us return to Kingsley’s heroine.
Hypatia, the beauty of whose thought has been suggested
in a preceding paragraph, does not remain resolute to the
end. Her attempt to prove that all that is noble and beautiful
has its source somewhere in the old pagan system of
philosophy, is as fine an attempt as could be made. But she
has undertaken the impossible, and her failure is certain.
Her pathetic subjection to the hypnotism and magic of old
Miriam seems in a way to portend her tragic death. Her
weakness at the end makes it appear that the author did not
intend determination to be her most striking virtue. Why
is it that, even in her martyrdom, Hypatia does not arouse
the reader’s sympathy as some of the other characters do?
It would seem that her position on a pedestal above the
ordinary run of mankind deprives her of the sympathy she
would otherwise deserve. But is this all? Her aloofness
from the multitude, her contempt for the rabble seem
almost justified; but are they, in a final analysis of the
truth? Recall Kingsley’s words, “My idea is to set forth
Christianity as the only really democratic creed, and philosophy,
above all spiritualism, as the most aristocratic
creed.” Let us apply the last part of this statement to
Hypatia. She denies entirely the salvation of her <i>aristocratic
creed</i> to the common herd, and to such as Pelagia,
the harlot. This is what finally repulses Philammon, in
what forms the climax of the story. Moreover, Hypatia
as a last resort has been forced to a belief in the “spiritualism”,
(for such it is), which old Miriam offers, but does
not herself accept. This part of the story shows the
aristocratic nature of philosophy as a creed, and especially
the sham of spiritualism.</p>

<p>And now let us consider the first part of the quotation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
just made. How does Kingsley set forth the value of true
Christianity “as the only really democratic creed”? He
starts by portraying the simplicity of life in the Laura and
of Philammon’s early training. When Philammon reaches
Alexandria, he does not scruple to risk his life for an unfortunate
negress, and he lives with the little porter on the
most democratic terms. Moreover, the generous care of
the sick shown in the daily visitations of Cyril, Peter the
Reader, and the parabolani, entirely overbalances the inconsistency,
or even vindictive cruelty, which they tolerate in
the name of the Church. But the most striking evidence of
Christianity as a democratic creed, is seen in the character
of Raphael Aben-Ezra, the converted Jew. If one is assiduous
in seeking parallels, it is possible to see in the early
life of Raphael traces of the Byronic hero. But just as
Kingsley shows the falsity of “Egyptian magic”, which had
been made important in earlier novels, so he shows the
falsity of any touches of Byronism which the character of
Raphael may display. He brings this character out of the
mazes of self-conceit and skepticism into something higher
and nobler. Raphael, though born to luxury and aristocratic
ease, has drained the cup of pleasure to the dregs,
and is willing to exchange aristocratic ease for democratic
poverty. He has also exhausted the resources of philosophy,
and has been thus prepared to appreciate more fully
the higher truth of Christianity. If one is to draw an
inference from biography, Kingsley has portrayed something
of the early doubts of his own mind, in the mental
struggles of Raphael. Raphael Aben-Ezra is perhaps as
well-done as any character in the novel. His calm reflections
on life in general make possible for us a more detached
view and a clearer interpretation of the life of the
time. The “philosophic” coolness, (to use a word which
he himself despised), with which he exchanges the role of
prince for that of beggar, gives evidence that he is genuine
and sincere. The depths of his character do not really
come to light, however, until in Italy he gets the first faint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
ray of genuine hope, a hope which grows stronger from that
time on. He is enabled to consider this hope as legitimate
and consistent with the words of God, whether Christian or
Hebrew, by the kindly advice of Synesius. But Raphael’s
real conversion takes place as he listens to the inspiring
words of St. Augustine, who is preaching not only <i>to</i> but
<i>for</i> the rough Roman legionaries. What wonder that he
was able to win them, heart and soul, when, as Raphael
says: “He has been speaking to these wild beasts as to
sages and saints; he has been telling them that God is as
much with them as with prophets and psalmists....
I wonder if Hypatia with all her beauty, could have
touched their hearts as he has done.” There is in this
passage the whole essence of Christianity as a democratic
creed. The conversion of Raphael prepares the way for
his intellectual triumph over Hypatia, whom he all but
convinces of the truth of his new creed. And the conclusion
of the story, portraying the humble Christian self-sacrifice
of Philammon, his sister and the other important
characters, completes the truthful presentation of Christianity
as a democratic creed.</p>

<p>Kingsley’s <i>Hypatia</i> possesses a depth of insight and a
richness of instruction which are equalled in few novels,
historical or otherwise. But what Kingsley achieved in
<i>Hypatia</i> may be summed up, for one who is studying the
novel of Roman life, as follows: First, he gave a complete
picture of life in the Roman Empire in an accurate historical
setting. Secondly, in portraying the climax of the
struggle between Christianity and the Roman world, he
showed the intimate connection and universal relations,
of life in the time of the Roman Empire, with life in the
ages which precede and follow it. In the first of these
achievements, no novelist has really surpassed Kingsley;
in the second, no one has come near equalling him. In
regard to the first achievement, Kingsley’s faithfulness to
history and to the life of the fifth century, it can be said
that his “history” has been criticised, for its alleged inaccuracy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
by pedants of the malignant school of criticism,
for whom history exists only as a means for tripping up
their betters. The hollow sham of such criticism is apparent,
if we merely allow to Kingsley the freedom accorded
to any historical novelist. He has in every respect lived
up to the promise of his masterful preface, in which he
says: “I have in my sketch of Hypatia and her fate, closely
followed authentic history, especially Socrates’ account of
the closing scenes, as given in <i>Book</i> III, <i>Sec.</i> 15, of his
<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>.” He also follows authentic history
in all other parts of the story where this is essential, adopting
the wise method, already discussed, of mingling historical
characters and events with imaginary characters
and events. When he is not making use of history, he is
nevertheless true to the spirit of history. His faithfulness
to the life of the times is all that he promises in these
words of the <i>Preface</i>: “I have labored honestly and industriously
to discover the truth, even in its minutest details,
and to sketch the age, its manners and its literature as I
found them,—altogether artificial, slipshod, effete, resembling
far more the times of Louis Quinze than those of
Sophocles and Plato.” In regard to Kingsley’s second
achievement in <i>Hypatia</i>, it may be said that in portraying
“the last struggle between the young Church and the Old
World,” (<i>Preface</i>), he showed the significance of a short
period of history, when fitted into the larger scheme of
universal history. In the conclusion of <i>Hypatia</i>, he says,
“I have shown you New Foes under an Old Face—your own
likeness in toga and bonnet.... There is nothing new
under the sun. The thing which has been, it is that which
shall be.” Other writers of the novel of Roman life have
shown with consummate art the thing which has been,—Christian
and Pagan; none have equalled Kingsley in showing
that it is also the thing which shall be. And even those
who refuse to draw a moral from any piece of fiction, may
read with infinite profit and pleasure the great novel which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
Kingsley’s scholarly insight into the life of the Roman
Empire enabled him to write.</p>

<p>John Henry Newman was a churchman, who became a
bitter opponent of Kingsley; his scholarship was profound,
and his early religious training, received from his French
Huguenot mother, was along Calvinistic lines. He knew the
Bible, it is said, almost by heart. He was led to go over to the
Church of Rome by his own studies, since he came to believe
that they furnished arguments in support of the Church of
Rome, rather than against it. He came to feel with conviction,
that the argument that “antiquity was the true
exponent of the doctrines of Christianity,” really supported
the Church of Rome. In this he was directly opposed to
Kingsley. It is commonly stated that Newman’s novel
<i>Callista</i>, (1855), was written in answer to Kingsley’s
<i>Hypatia</i>, and this is probably correct. The climax of the
public controversy between Kingsley and Newman, however,
did not come until 1864, almost ten years later. In
his <i>Postscript</i> to <i>Callista</i>, Newman refers to Lockhart’s
<i>Valerius</i> in such a way as to imply that it is the only other
important novel of Roman life, which presents the struggles
of Christianity in a philosophical light. He thus intentionally
disregards Kingsley’s recently published <i>Hypatia</i>.
<i>Callista</i> is the story of a martyr in the African Church,
under the Decian persecution. Its scene is laid in Sicca
Veneria, near Carthage, and its portrayal of life in the
Roman Empire is accurate and realistic. The heartlessness
of the Roman magistrates,—both in their persecution
of the Christians and in their characteristic strokes of policy
in dealing with the mob,—reveals the spirit of Roman
life. Local color is especially good, the description of the
plague of locusts being the best that exists anywhere in
literature, (not excepting even the Bible). Newman follows
Kingsley in making his heroine a girl of Greek descent,
whose ideas of the beauty which she saw in paganism led
her to be repulsed by the religion of the Crucified God. But
unlike Hypatia, Callista becomes entirely converted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>The finest piece of writing in Newman’s novel, however,
is the scene between Callista and Agellius, in which she
repudiates Christianity. St. Cyprian, who had been mentioned
by Kingsley, is brought into <i>Callista</i>; and others
high in the Church play a part in the story. Cyprian says
the discipline of the Church had become less firm in the
interval before the Decian persecution. The author is thus
enabled to show that the Church was strengthened by this
persecution. To mention familiar elements, magic appears
in <i>Callista</i>, in the spells and herbs of a witch, which result
in her victim being possessed of a demon; the labyrinth
motive also appears in the description of the secret passages,
by which Callista escapes and which enable the Christians
to remain concealed. In any final analysis <i>Callista</i>
cannot be compared with Kingsley’s <i>Hypatia</i>. In spite of
some very fine passages, it is lacking in uniform excellence.
In its portrayal of life in the Roman empire, and in its
handling of Christianity it falls short of the deep significance
intended. There is indeed too much theological discussion.
While <i>Callista</i> is a novel of Roman life, and can
be read as such, it leans somewhat in the direction of the
story of religious instruction, a kind of fiction we have
mentioned as an offshoot of the novel of Roman life. Here
we may recall that <i>Fabiola</i> by Cardinal Wiseman, had appeared
the year before <i>Callista</i>; <i>Fabiola</i> represents the
story of religious instruction <i>par excellence</i>. Cardinal
Wiseman had been for a number of years Professor of
Oriental languages at Roman University in Rome, and it is
likely that his study of Roman antiquities at Rome would
have enabled him to make <i>Fabiola</i> a novel of Roman life;
instead he made it a stereotyped story of religious instruction.
This oft-rewritten horror continues to afford the
young the opportunity to enjoy killing off martyrs to their
hearts’ content. We thus find it necessary again to dismiss
the story of religious instruction from primary consideration,
but to remember its presence in the background.
Stories of this kind, by the prominent place they gave to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Christianity, set a precedent which seemed to bind authors
of the novel of Roman life to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>After the publication of <i>Callista</i>, a number of preachers,
who wrote stories of religious instruction, were enabled by
their scholarship, to embellish their work to some extent
with a portrayal of Roman life. But even so, their work
was often intended primarily for younger readers; their
books are commonly classed as juvenile. Books of this kind
were written by the Rev. John Neale, the Rev. A. D. Crake,
the Rev. G. S. Davies and the Rev. A. J. Church. The last-named
author was the most scholarly; and his work was
excluded in Section I of this study, rather because it was
intended for boys than because it represented the story of
religious instruction. In considering the work of preachers,
we have to pass over some years before we come to the
truly great portrayal of life at Rome in the form of fiction,
which is seen in Canon Frederic W. Farrar’s <i>Darkness and
Dawn</i>, (1892). This is called by its author <i>An Historic
Tale</i>, and he distinctly says it is not a novel; but in spite of
his modest estimate of his own work, <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>
is a great novel in every respect, except that it lacks a
highly-developed artificial plot. And such a plot is unnecessary,
since the element of suspense and even a certain
unity of effect are attained merely by a faithful and realistic
narration of events, either historical or characteristic of the
time. Canon Farrar saw that the age of Nero supplied the
best material for the work he contemplated; and in portraying
life at Rome in Nero’s time with realistic effect,
he has surpassed every other English novelist who has
written of that period, and is not himself surpassed even by
Sienkiewicz, the Polish author of <i>Quo Vadis</i>, (1895).</p>

<p>In writing <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>, Canon Farrar made full,
though judicious, use of his profound scholarship, which in
its thoroughness equals that of Charles Kingsley. He
equals Kingsley’s <i>Hypatia</i> in his portrayal of life in the
past,—“the thing which has been,”—though he does not
attempt in quite the same way to show that it is also “the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
thing which shall be.” In spite of its figurative title, <i>Darkness
and Dawn</i> does not quite bring the reader to the same
realization of the onward sweep of history, the march of
civilization, the gradual victory of Christianity, that <i>Hypatia</i>
does. But in presenting the contrasts in Christian and
Pagan life at Rome with faithful exactness, and in terms
of the life of today, Farrar teaches his lesson in a different
way. While he does not fit his picture of a period of history
into the scheme of universal history in the same way
that Kingsley does, he portrays the life of the time of Nero
with a minuteness of detail which had not been attempted
by Kingsley in his portrayal of the life of the Roman
Empire in <i>Hypatia</i>. Farrar leaves the reader more to
derive his own lesson from the facts,—but the sermon is
there and may be considered universal in its application.
It is only fair, however, to consider <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>
chiefly for its portrayal of Roman life. As has been
hinted, there is a distinct difference in the method of Farrar’s
portrayal of the past, from that used by Kingsley.
Kingsley selects what he considers the important things in
the life of the past, and shows their significance. Farrar,
on the other hand, gives everything which may be of any
consequence, with the most minute exactness of detail.
Kingsley’s history had been unfairly criticised; Farrar’s
is beyond criticism. Farrar not only sifts and weighs the
finest points in matters of historical accuracy, but also gives
the most painstaking and detailed description of manners,
customs, habits, dress, and all other things which aid the
reader in obtaining an intimate knowledge of the time with
which his story deals.</p>

<p>Between the date of publication of <i>Hypatia</i>, (1853), and
that of <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>, (1892), there had come about
a marked change in methods of scholarship, especially of
classical scholarship; and the effect of this is to be seen in
<i>Darkness and Dawn</i>. This change in methods of scholarship
is chiefly characterized by an insistence upon the
minute analysis of historical facts, and of the manners of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
the ancients. Its effect upon the English novel of Roman
life is due to the influence of the painstaking research made
by scholars, usually Germans, in the field of Roman private
life and Roman archæology; and to the influence of novels
of Roman life which made use of such research, and were
written by Germans. This influence will be discussed more
thoroughly, when we have concluded our study of the English
novel of Roman life as written by Churchmen.</p>

<p>The time of Nero’s reign at Rome is so crowded with
historical events of interest that Farrar was enabled to
make nearly all important events in his novel, <i>Darkness
and Dawn</i>, either absolutely true to history, or so closely
connected with history, that they might actually have happened
at the time when they are supposed to have happened.
The few unimportant and intentional anachronisms he has
made are explained candidly in his preface. The events
described in the novel, though nearly all of them actually
happened in Nero’s reign, represent in kind and variety
nearly all events which are narrated in other important
novels of Roman life. The scenes portrayed are all thoroughly
typical of life in ancient Rome. Neither Christian
nor pagan life is overemphasized, although a natural and
truthful contrast is made of them. Scenes in Nero’s palace,
in the forum, in the crowded streets of Rome, at the amphitheatre,
at the law-courts, and occasionally in the fashionable
suburbs of the city, or at Nero’s various resorts away
from Rome, are portrayed with a fidelity which cannot be
questioned. And wherever it is possible to make a scene of
realistic effect out of an actual historical event, or to add
historical details to a scene which significantly portrays
Roman life, the author does so. Yet in spite of the fact
that so many scenes in Farrar’s novel are taken from history,
it is by no means made heavy or overcrowded, with
historical detail. Every detail is made significant and interesting,
and put in its proper place, so that the general
effort is not one of laborious effort but of consummate art.
The minutiae of the picture, while effective in themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
do not obscure its larger lines. Few authors could have
presented such a mass of historical detail and intimate information
of the life of Rome in a single volume with such
fine realistic effect. Farrar was able to make his scholarship
count in producing a noble work of fiction; while
others in attempting a similar thing were only able to compile
what were practically dry hand-books of Roman
antiquities.</p>

<p>In its portrayal of character <i>Darkness and Dawn</i> is
equally true to life and history. So much is known of so
many important historical characters of Nero’s time, that
it becomes not only possible, but even advisable, to make use
of only historical characters in a novel which deals with
this period. Realizing this, Farrar dispensed almost entirely
with imaginary characters. But he selected a large
number of historical characters representing all ranks and
conditions of life. And since some of these are taken from
humble life, and do not play an important part in history,
the author found it necessary to describe the course of their
lives from his own imagination, aided by his thorough
knowledge of the life of the time. It proved, for example,
a very happy device to devote a considerable part of the
narrative to a description of the wanderings of the runaway
slave, Onesimus; for by this means the author was
able to bring in many incidents, showing the variety of
experiences that even a Roman slave might have. Onesimus
is in fear of crucifixion; and is actually sentenced to
the recognized punishment for a certain offense, of being
thrown into the sea, sewed into a sack with a dog, a cat,
and a viper. He also meets the King of the Grove at
Aricia, a circumstance which reminds one of perhaps the
most “pagan” of pagan customs surviving in the vicinity
of Rome, as late as the time of Nero. Only a few of Farrar’s
characters are unimportant historically, while the
mere names of the others remind the reader of history.
Agrippina, Nero, Seneca, Burrus, Pomponia, Acte, Poppæa,
Tigellinus, St. John, and St. Paul are all important historical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
figures. Farrar relates with accurate historical detail
all the necessary facts concerning them; but he really
brings them out of the realm of mere history, and makes
them stand before one as real men and women like ourselves.</p>

<p>Where Farrar particularly excels is in his portrayal of
the development of character; and in his delineation of the
aspect which a conspicuous character will assume in the
presence of death or of a great emergency. The portrayal
of the development of Agrippina’s character is particularly
fine, even though death takes her from the scene. She is
shown as a character who combines strength of determination
with a marked weakness in certain other ways. Her
determination is shown in the pursuit of her ambition to
gain and hold absolute power. Her weakness is seen to
increase from the time when she begins to realize that Nero
no longer feels her influence. She finally sinks to abject
despair when she becomes certain that the nearness of her
death is only a question of time. The changes of Nero’s
character are also portrayed with masterful strokes. At
first he is an ingenuous, sweet-natured boy, guided in the
main by the advice of Agrippina and of his tutor, the
philosopher Seneca; he only gives, in occasional fits of temper,
the vaguest suggestions of what he was to become
later. Farrar is careful to show that in passing from the
sphere of boyhood to manhood and the duties of imperial
office, Nero carried with him a certain puerility,—indeed
remained puerile until his death. The author also shows
how the germs of the most contemptible qualities of Nero
were really fostered by Agrippina, who, while weakly pampering
him, little realized how soon he would outgrow her
control. Nero’s degeneration into the cruel monster and
shallow buffoon well known to history is fearlessly
painted by Farrar. His contemptible fear of death, and
self-pity when death is certain, though suggested by history,
are brought home to the reader with a realistic effect
surpassing that of any merely historical narrative. Somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
in contrast to Nero’s death is that of Seneca, who was
compelled to commit suicide by Nero’s decree. Seneca
meets death with the resignation of a pagan philosopher,
but perhaps not with true heroism. It remains for the
Christians, St. Paul and St. John, to enable the author, by
a simple narration of their suffering, to portray the unflinching
courage and sublime hope of truly great characters
in their hours of trial. Neither the stories of these
two saints nor that of Nero’s living torches, is overdone,
however. Nor is undue use of the sensational made in the
revelation of the orgies at Nero’s revels, and the description
of scenes in the arena. The author simply shows
Christianity in the lives of a few historical characters such
as St. Paul, St. John, Pomponia, Acte and Onesimus; he is
not unfair, and is thoroughly accurate, in his portrayal of
the pagans. He gives impartially both sides of the picture,—the
light and shadow which the title of his novel
implies. Its portrayal of human life, Christian and pagan,
and its revelation of human character, give <i>Darkness and
Dawn</i> the right to share with <i>Hypatia</i> a position of preeminence
among English novels describing life in the
Roman Empire, and owing their value in large part to the
scholarship of great preachers.</p>

<p>Canon Farrar’s other great novel was called <i>Gathering
Clouds</i> (1895), and has for its scene Constantinople in the
days of St. Chrysostom. Besides the fact that the date of
its story is rather late, the scene of the novel makes it inadvisable
for us to consider it at length; especially since the
author’s other novel has just furnished ample evidence of
his ability to portray life at Rome; and he could gain nothing
by transferring the scene to Constantinople. Alexandria,
in which much of the scene of Kingsley’s <i>Hypatia</i> is
laid, has been considered as the metropolis of a Roman
province. But Constantinople in Chrysostom’s time was
not in a province of the Western Empire, but was the capital
of the Eastern Empire. And, while there are many
interesting parallels to life at Rome to be found in novels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
dealing with Constantinople, as capital of the Eastern Empire,
it has seemed best not to consider such novels in detail,
in a discussion of the novel of Roman life. In fact, the
only other important English novel, which has for its scene
Constantinople when Rome still remained capital of the
Western Empire, is Sir Henry Pottinger’s <i>Blue and Green</i>.
This is a realistic story of the riot arising between the two
factions, partisans of the rival colors of the chariot-racing
companies, but unfortunately is now out of print.</p>

<p>There remains one other novel of Roman life written by
a preacher, which deserves especial consideration. This is
the Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould’s <i>Domitia</i>. If one asks why
this novel is especially to be considered, the answer is once
more to be found in a realization of the author’s scholarly
attainments. <i>Domitia</i> reveals a careful and minute study
of Roman history, and especially of Roman private life. It
is full of information regarding the life, habits, and dress
of Romans in the time of Nero and Domitian. Instead of
burdening his pages with footnotes in fine print, the author
conceived the idea that such information could be contained
in separate paragraphs and inserted bodily into the narrative;
and in carrying out this idea he was so successful that
the wealth of information conveyed without serious interruption
of the narrative, gives <i>Domitia</i> its distinguishing
characteristic. When a Roman galley is mentioned in the
story, the author inserts a paragraph describing such a
galley; when a funeral is to take place, he inserts a similar
description of a Roman funeral,—and so with other details
of Roman private life and custom. History is inserted into
the narrative in the same way, but the author wisely refrains
from making too great a use of history. The time
with which his novel deals includes part of Nero’s reign
and all of Domitian’s; the interval between them is
covered briefly. The most dramatic historical episodes narrated
are the death of Nero and the death of Domitian, but
other scenes taken from history are realistically portrayed.
Nero and Domitian are also the most important historical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
figures, and their characters are well brought out. The
heroine of the novel, Domitia, the wife and supposed cousin
of the Emperor Domitian, is not very important in formal
history; but from a few hints given by history, the author
has drawn a character thoroughly human, and such as
might have lived at the time. Her mother, representing the
frivolous and self-seeking type of Roman matron, is thoroughly
characteristic of the time of Domitian. Her father,
the soldier who has given his life to his duty to his country,
represents by his character the old Roman virtues, which
still survived in the hearts of a few men. While Domitia
becomes a Christian, her story is not so told as to emphasize
Christianity unduly; and in telling it, the author has given
us a notable novel of Roman life, sound in its history and
its revelation of Roman private life, and presenting a story
of human interest.</p>

<p>Baring-Gould also wrote <i>Perpetua</i> (1897), a novel which
suggests something of Roman life. Its subject reminds one
that he edited <i>The Lives of the Saints</i> with an erudition
which shows his knowledge of Roman life. <i>Perpetua</i> is the
story of a Christian martyr to the later Roman persecution
at Nimes, in the Roman province of Gaul. The Emperor
Caracalla, by whom the edict for this persecution was issued,
does not appear in the story, and, of course, the life
in the provincial town of Nimes only vaguely suggests life
in the capital. But some customs are represented, which
had spread from Rome throughout the provinces. Since
<i>Perpetua</i> was published the year before <i>Domitia</i>, it is probable
that their author had some things in mind when writing
the former, which he did not use until he wrote the latter
novel. Nimes was selected for the scene of <i>Perpetua</i>,
because the author had visited the town and become familiar
with its history and archæology. He was thus able to
reconstruct accurately the life of its people, as they thronged
the festival of the local divinity, or crowded into the
amphitheatre to witness persecution of the Christians.
Roman paganism is seen to be losing its grip, since the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
pagan citizens do not all take the local god very seriously.
The element of “magic” in pagan superstition is seen in the
deception practiced by the priestesses of the god; they make
his voice sound over the town by shouting into a trumpet-shaped
amplifier, which magnifies the sound. Another
familiar element in the novel of Roman life is seen in the
labyrinth motive, which appears when the hero of the story
makes his escape from the prison through a dark, vile, and
tortuous drain. Christianity, while it appears to be still
weak, if one looks upon some of the wavering converts who
are represented, is seen to be growing in strength, when
one realizes the unyielding faith of Perpetua, and of a few
others. But too much is not made of Christianity, and
Baring-Gould’s novel is not to be considered a story of religious
instruction. <i>Perpetua</i> is chiefly important to our
subject in that it suggests the work which its author was to
do in his other novel, <i>Domitia</i>. There is little use made in
<i>Perpetua</i> of important historical events or characters. The
heroine’s name, “Perpetua,” was suggested by that of a
martyr of the persecution at Carthage, whose story is well
known, and does not belong to the history of Nimes. Since
the publication of <i>Domitia</i>, no very important novel of
Roman life has been written in English by any great scholarly
preacher. Many other preachers have written books
of considerable merit, which portray something of Roman
life; but further discussion of these books is withheld, since
they are primarily stories of religious instruction, or are
intended only for younger readers.</p>

<h3 id="III_B">B. THOROUGHNESS IN SCHOLARSHIP, RESULTING IN PART
FROM THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH GERMAN SCHOLARS AS
BECKER,—BECKER’S “GALLUS”</h3>

<p>We have made some mention of the scholarship of German
writers; the Germans were not the only classical scholars
whose influence is important in our study, but in some
cases made an exceedingly thorough study of the private
life of the Romans, and the effect of this is seen upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
English novel of Roman life. An exceedingly careful attention
to minute details in the study of the private life of
the Romans is seen in the work of Professor W. A. Becker
in <i>Gallus, or Roman Scenes in the Time of Augustus</i>, published
in Leipsic (1838). This is not a novel at all, though
it contains some connected material in the form of fiction.
The importance of Becker’s <i>Gallus</i> in its effect upon the
novel of Roman life, has been overemphasized by pedantic
schoolmen; but it served to show English scholars the necessity
for absolute exactness, even to the most minute details,
in all matters pertaining to the study of the private life of
the Romans. Becker is not in any sense to be considered
a pupil of Scott, though his work was published shortly
after the world had read the last of Scott’s novels. But
Becker showed later German followers of Scott how it was
possible to present with minute accuracy the life of the
Romans; and these German historical novelists who thus
portrayed Roman life, had an important influence upon the
English novel of Roman life, as has been suggested in connection
with Canon Farrar’s <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>. In <i>Gallus</i>,
which we have said is not a novel, Becker says (in the
Preface), “His original intention was to produce a systematic
handbook, but finding this would lead to too much
brevity and curtailment, and exclude altogether several
minor traits, ... which were highly necessary to
a complete portrait of Roman life, he was induced to imitate
the example of Bottiger and Mazois, and produce a
continuous story, with explanatory notes on each chapter.
Those topics which required more elaborate investigation,
have been handled at length in Excursus.” The “continuous
story” which Becker chose was that of “Cornelius
Gallus, a man whose fortunate rise from obscurity to splendor
and honor, love of Lycoris, and poetical talents, render
him not a little remarkable.” The author tells the story of
Gallus, wherever possible, absolutely in accordance with
history. He cites as his sources for this personal history<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Dio Cassius, Strabo, Suetonius, Vergil, Propertius and Ovid.
He says further that “the Augustan age is decidedly the
happiest time to select,” for a portraiture of Roman manners,
since for the study of Roman private life of that period there
is abundant source-material. He says that “apart from the
numerous antique monuments which have been dug up, and
placed in museums, our most important authorities on
Roman private life are the later poets, as Juvenal, Martial,
Statius: then Petronius, Seneca, Suetonius, the two Plinys,
Cicero’s speeches and letters, the elegiac poets, and especially
Horace. Next come the grammarians and the digests;
while the Greek authors, as Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
Plutarch, Dio Cassius, Lucian, Athenaeus, and the lexicographers,
as Pollux, still further enlighten us.” In his
careful citation of sources, and careful choice of what were
the best sources, Becker pointed the way for all those who
wrote of Roman life, whether they wrote in the form of
the novel or not. He succeeded in making his work what he
wished it to be, “a desirable repository of whatever is most
worth knowing about the private life of the Romans.”
Moreover, while Becker’s work does not pretend to be a
novel, and is far too learned and ponderous to be called a
novel, he unconsciously aided later writers of the novel of
Roman life by showing them what a mistake it would be to
overcrowd such a novel with details of Roman private life.
At the same time they might derive some profit from <i>Gallus</i>
as a model of accuracy in such matters. Becker’s work
was a step in the proof of the fact that the later novel of
Roman life must be accurate and precise in matters of
scholarship. It is true that Bulwer had done somewhat the
same thing that Becker claims to do in <i>Gallus</i>, but Becker’s
meticulous regard for detail, while showing English novelists
what to avoid, also aided them to a more full appreciation
of the necessity for absolute accuracy, even in matters
of small importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<h3 id="III_C">C. GERMAN FOLLOWERS OF SCOTT—THE GERMAN NOVEL OF
ROMAN LIFE; ITS INFLUENCE ON THE ENGLISH NOVEL</h3>

<p>If Becker and other German scholars showed scholars
elsewhere the necessity of thoroughness in classical scholarship,
and added much to their study of Roman life, it is
equally true that Sir Walter Scott showed the world the
possibilities of the historical novel. Needless to say Scott
had imitators throughout Europe and America; and not
only was his success immediate, but his influence on the
historical novel was a permanent thing. Many who eagerly
devoured his novels in boyhood became his imitators in later
life. Not a few of these historical novelists were Germans,
and some of their finest works deal with the life of ancient
Rome. The authors of these novels endeavored to imitate
Scott in many of the things which made his historical novels
successful; for example, they saw that the life of Rome supplied
them with gorgeous historical scenes, just as the life
of mediæval times had supplied such scenes to Scott. But
they especially resolved to follow Scott in presenting realistic
descriptions of manners, and it must be admitted that
some of them described the manners of Roman times quite
as well as Scott had described the manners of mediæval
times. These German novelists, such as George Ebers,
were well fitted to describe the manners of Rome, since they
were thorough students of Roman things; and they had been
shown how these things could be presented, by Becker and
other scholars, who wrote some years before them.</p>

<p>In 1876 was published <i>A Struggle for Rome</i>, by Julius
Sophus Felix Dahn. This is Dahn’s greatest novel, and
portrays with fine realistic effect the struggle between the
Ostrogoths and Belisarius. In this, and in its handling of
the character of Totila, it suggests the great novel of George
Gissing, <i>Veranilda</i> (1904). Another prominent character
besides Totila, in Dahn’s novel, is Cassiodorus. The scene
in part is laid at Ravenna, and the decay and final collapse
of the Gothic kingdom are well illustrated. In 1882 Dahn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
began a series of short novels, illustrating, he says, the
spread of Roman civilization, which went hand in hand with
the decline of Roman power over the migrating German
tribes. The first of these novels is <i>Felicitas</i> (1882), which
describes the capture of the distinctly Roman town of
Claudium Juvavum (now Salzburg), by the Germans. The
author gained his material when he was employed at Salzburg,
in the archives, library, and museum of Roman antiquities.
He added to his fund of thorough information by
explorations in the vicinity of the town, finding many
Roman things of interest. <i>Felicitas</i> well illustrates the
thoroughness of research and the acute scientific spirit,
which the Germans in a measure gave to the novel of Roman
life. It also tells a story of deep human interest. In 1894
Dahn published <i>A Captive of the Roman Eagles</i>, a novel
which tells the story of Bissula, and portrays the struggle
between the Romans and the Alemanni near Lake Constance.
This novel is also a model of thoroughness and historical
accuracy. Dahn’s last novel, which appeared shortly
after, was call <i>The Scarlet Banner</i> (1864), and paints
with a like accuracy the overthrow of the Vandal king,
Gelimer, by Belisarius.</p>

<p>The historical novels of George Ebers, and the profound
classical scholarship he displayed in some of them, are well
known everywhere. While his important series of historical
novels, starting with <i>An Egyptian Princess</i> (1879), is
designed principally to follow the course of history in
Egypt, some of its numbers illustrate Roman life and
Roman history. In 1881 appeared <i>The Emperor</i>, which
presents a fine picture of life in the time of Hadrian. While
the scene is laid mainly in Egypt, life in Alexandria is
shown as presenting a close parallel to that of Rome. The
sternness of Roman dominion in Egypt and the growth of
Christianity in the Empire are brought home to the reader
with many minute touches which show the author’s acuteness.
The richly pictorial style is well suited to the description
of splendid scenes, and the manners of private life are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
portrayed with accuracy of detail. Ebers also excels in his
analysis of character. The Emperor Hadrian, who appears
first as a benevolent philosopher, soon shows that he is capable
of becoming a cruel tyrant. The character of Hadrian’s
wife Sabina is also carefully analyzed, while his favorite,
the beautiful youth Antinous, plays a prominent part in the
story. It is likely that this gave a suggestion to Professor
Hausroth (pseud. George Taylor), who made Antinous the
hero of his novel of that name, which appeared in the same
year as <i>The Emperor</i>.</p>

<p>In 1885 Ebers published <i>Serapis</i>, which portrays life in
Alexandria in the time of Theodosius, and reveals much of
Roman customs. The struggle between Christians and
pagans is represented as culminating in the destruction of
the temple of Serapis, and the demolition of the gigantic
image of the god. This was a result of the edict abolishing
the worship of idols. The dramatic scene in which the temple
of Serapis is defended by a multitude of pagans, who
have stored arms there, has appeared many years later in
the novel of Roman life of the American author, T. Everett
Harré, called <i>Behold the Woman</i> (1916). Another interesting
point is that <i>Serapis</i> contains a splendid scene describing
a chariot race, in which a Christian defeats a
pagan, after the occurrence of a fatal accident. This scene
may have been suggested to Ebers by the famous scene in
<i>Ben Hur</i> (1880); while on the other hand it is likely that
General Wallace, the American author of <i>Ben Hur</i>, owes
some of his exactness in matters of scholarship to the example
of such German scholars as George Ebers.</p>

<p>Another of Ebers’ novels which portrayed much of
Roman life was <i>Per Aspera</i> (<i>A Thorny Path</i>) (1892).
While the scene is again Alexandria, <i>Per Aspera</i>, like <i>The
Emperor</i>, shows that city at the time of the visit paid to it
by the Roman Emperor. In <i>Per Aspera</i> the Emperor is
Bassianus, whose nickname, “Caracalla,” was derived from
his custom of wearing a hood (caracalla). The portrait
of Caracalla is well done, showing his physical and mental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
suffering, his pride, his dreams and his increasing insanity.
The Christians are portrayed in a natural light, while pagan
customs are well explained, and the splendor, display and
wealth of Alexandria dazzle the imagination. The labyrinth
motive appears in the mystery of the secret passages of the
temple of Serapis. Scenes representing gladiators in the
arena are characteristically Roman, while the slaughter of
the youths in the parade-ground shows the cruelty of Rome
and the power of her Emperor. Yet Ebers, with his usual
insight into human character, shows that the Emperor, who
could cruelly punish those who had wittily derided him,
found his power of little ultimate value to him. In speaking
of the Emperor’s poor health, mention is made of the
great Roman physician, Galen, who plays an important part
in Mr. E. L. White’s <i>Andivius Hedulio</i> (1921).</p>

<p>The next of Ebers’ novels to be considered is <i>Cleopatra</i>
(1894). While it contains many characteristic touches,
which show Ebers’ knowledge of life in what was soon to
become permanently a Roman province, <i>Cleopatra</i> is not so
much a portrayal of Roman life as a sympathetic interpretation
of the later history of Egypt’s great queen. Ebers,
as usual, is absolutely true to history, but endeavors to present
Cleopatra as a human being, subject to strong emotions,
rather than as an historical figure. Even Antony
appears not so much in the character of a Roman general,
as in that of a strong man who influences the character of
Cleopatra. The chief value of Ebers’ <i>Cleopatra</i> lies in the
fact that Ebers has come much nearer to presenting the real
character of Cleopatra than has any other novelist. Sir
Rider Haggard’s <i>Cleopatra</i> has been mentioned as a poor
piece of work, while in Mr. W. S. Davis’s excellent novel,
<i>A Friend of Caesar</i> (1900), Cleopatra is merely represented
as a young girl.</p>

<p>A beautiful little novel which Ebers calls <i>A Question; the
Idyll of a Picture by His Friend Alma Tadema</i> (1881), is
written in a style quite different from that of his other
novels. Its scene is Sicily, near Aetna, at a “time when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
entire earth and air were peopled with gods, nymphs and
satyrs.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It is mentioned here because in its scene, its
theme, and the simplicity and beauty of its style, there is a
strong suggestion of the recently published novel of Mr.
Eden Phillpotts, <i>Evander</i> (1919), the scene of which is
prehistoric Italy. <i>Evander</i> gives one an idea of the first
faint beginnings of Roman life in a semi-mythological setting
similar to that of <i>A Question</i>.</p>

<p>The novels of Ernst Eckstein were almost as widely read
in England and America as those of Ebers. Some of them
equal or even surpass Ebers’ best work. <i>Quintus Claudius</i>
(1881), gives a splendid portrayal of life in Rome under
Domitian. The author has presented in a single story
practically the whole life of Rome, and has described the
most noted characters of the time. “The life and manners
of all classes at this period were never painted with a bolder
pencil than by Eckstein in this masterly romance, which
displays as much scholarship as invention.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In this review
a better expression than “invention” would be “a gifted
imagination and a deep insight into human nature.” In
<i>Quintus Claudius</i>, the character of Domitia is interpreted
in an entirely different way from that in which Baring-Gould
interpreted it in <i>Domitia</i> (1898); but this does not
mean that either author was untrue to history, since little
is known of her, save that she and her Emperor-husband
were at variance. In Eckstein’s novel the intrigues of
Domitia really furnish the central theme, rather than the
affairs of the imaginary Quintus Claudius, who spurns her
and loves Cornelia. Quintus and Cornelia are very finely
characterized, the former being by no means perfect, and
subject to the vices of the time, although he later becomes a
Christian. Among historical characters the poet Martial
is portrayed as the court parasite that he was. The conspiracy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
against Domitian is described with historical accuracy
and fine realistic effect. The book ends with the
murder of Domitian and the accession of Trajan. Nerva is
mentioned but not as an emperor.</p>

<p>In <i>Prusias</i> (1882), Eckstein rises to the greatness of his
theme. The story is that of the revolt, in which Roman
slaves, under the leadership of Spartacus, rose against
Roman oppression. The character of Spartacus, in every
respect true to history, is made to represent democracy and
freedom. Coming, as it did, shortly after the Civil War
had settled the slavery question in America, <i>Prusias</i> had a
wide reading here. To supplement the fine character of
Spartacus, Prusias, the technical hero of the story, is also
represented as magnanimous and farsighted, well-fitted to
aid the great general of the slaves in inspiring them to fight
for freedom. By a stroke of genius, Prusias, who first appears
in the disguise of a Chaldean magician, is conceived
to be the brother and agent of Mithradates, King of Pontus.
Rome’s two most powerful enemies are thus allied against
her. While Prusias does much of the planning of the conspiracy,
he does not overshadow the general of the slaves.
The truly great historical character, Spartacus, is presented
with a power not since equaled in fiction, and only approached
by the Rev. A. J. Church in his excellent book for boys,
<i>Two Thousand Years Ago</i> (1885), written shortly afterward.
<i>Prusias</i> also portrays life in the city of Rome under
the republic with accurate detail.</p>

<p>In <i>The Chaldean Magician</i> (1886), Eckstein portrays life
at Rome under Diocletian. The varied phases of the many-sided
life at Rome are brought into the picture in many
ways, and Diocletian’s persecution of the Christians is given
its due place. But as the title implies, the author gives
especial attention to the magic arts which were practiced
by Chaldean astrologers at Rome. The character of the
“Chaldean Magician” had been in Eckstein’s mind when he
was writing <i>Prusias</i>, and he took the opportunity of giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
it greater prominence in his novel named for such a character.
In fact, from the date of this novel, the figure of
the Chaldean astrologer supplants that of the priest who
deals in “Egyptian magic,” in those novels which deal with
magic imported from foreign lands to Rome. It became
the fashion for wealthy Romans to keep a Chaldean astrologer
in their household, and such a character appears in
Baring-Gould’s <i>Domitia</i>, and in Mr. W. S. Davis’s <i>A Friend
of Caesar</i>.</p>

<p>Eckstein’s greatest novel of Roman life was <i>Nero</i> (1889).
It was impossible for him to surpass the portrayal of the
general life of Rome, which he had already made in his
earlier novels; but in dealing with life in the time of Nero,
he found the greatest opportunity to display his talents. In
his faithfulness to the life and history of the time he prepared
the way for the two other authors who have written
great novels dealing with Nero’s time,—Canon Farrar in
<i>Darkness and Dawn</i> (1892), and H. Sienkiewicz in <i>Quo
Vadis</i> (1895). He was also closely followed by Hugh Westbury
in <i>Acte</i> (1890), and by two writers of books for boys,
the Rev. A. J. Church in <i>The Burning of Rome</i> (1892), and
G. A. Henty in <i>Beric, the Briton</i> (1892). Eckstein’s keenness
in portraying the court intrigues of Agrippina, Seneca,
and Tigellinus, shows his understanding of human nature.
But his greatest triumph is in the analysis of the character
of Nero. The early boyhood of Nero, and his ingenuous
love for Acte, who is kidnapped and kept hidden by the
agents of Agrippina, are revealed with genuine sympathy.
And Nero’s later development is traced step by step, with a
fairness that makes him appear the victim not only of his
own weakness, but of circumstance. In his revelation of
character, as shown in his handling of the character of
Nero or of Spartacus, Eckstein surpasses even the notable
work of George Ebers.</p>

<h4>REVIEW OF THE INFLUENCE OF GERMAN SCHOLARS AND
AUTHORS</h4>

<p>It is not intended to overemphasize the importance of the
influence of German scholars and authors upon the English
novel of Roman life. The influence of work such as that of
Becker upon the English novel of Roman life may be described
as follows: (1) It stimulated many English
scholars to study the life of ancient Rome with a similar
insistence upon accuracy in regard to the most minute details
of history and archæology; in one or two instances an
attempted imitation of work like Becker’s is seen in the
work of pedantic authors of the novel of Roman life. (2)
It served as one of the influences, which led popular writers
of the novel of Roman life to realize the need for at least
some accurate study of the history and life of Rome. The
influence of German novelists such as Ebers and Eckstein,
upon the English novel of Roman life, is seen in the more
thorough scholarship which such English novels display,—especially
after the publication of Eckstein’s <i>Nero</i>, which
is the first of a series of important novels portraying life
in Nero’s time. This series, as has been said, includes not
only Farrar’s great novel, <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>, and other
English fictions, but also the fine work of the Polish author,
Sienkiewicz, in <i>Quo Vadis</i> (1895). In speaking of the thoroughness
of German scholars, it might be said that in some
instances German novelists such as Ebers, seem occasionally
to have made the mistake of assuming that a mass of particulars
heaped together can be shaped into the aspect of a
general truth. In pursuing the details of a picture of
Roman life, they have lost sight of its larger lines sometimes;
but, on the whole, very rarely. We must not forget
that there were English scholars, who played their part in
impressing upon historical novelists the necessity for accuracy.
But the German authors of novels of Roman life,
produced so many good novels of this kind in so short a
time, that their influence is seen in the work of English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
novelists, both in regard to the subjects which English
writers have chosen, and in the methods of presenting such
subjects taken from Roman life.</p>

<h3 id="III_D">D. TWO PEDANTIC NOVELS OF ROMAN LIFE</h3>

<p>Few novelists have made the mistake of attempting to
include in a novel such work as appears in Becker’s <i>Gallus</i>.
But in one or two instances, novelists have tried to crowd
their pages with antiquarian knowledge, putting into their
narratives matters which Becker would have placed in his
Excursus. This pedantic display of knowledge is in itself
a defect, and we shall consider separately two novelists
who proved to be guilty of it. Miles Gerald Keon, British
Colonial Secretary to Bermuda, wrote, in 1866, a novel
called <i>Dion and the Sibyls</i>. This was published in London.
In spite of its pedanticism, it contains some interesting
similarities to the much greater work of General Lew Wallace
in <i>Ben Hur</i> (1880). Like <i>Ben Hur</i> it deals with the
time of Christ, and a further similarity is seen in the fact
that the author does not make the mistake of portraying
Christ as one of the central figures, and does not lay much
of the scene in Jerusalem. Keon’s hero, Dion, also, like
Ben Hur, is not too closely identified with Christianity,
though he is invited to expound its doctrines before the
Emperor. Scenes in Judea in <i>Dion and the Sibyls</i> include
the banquet at which John the Baptist is beheaded, and a
pedantic display of knowledge is made in repeating things
told of Herod Agrippa, Herodias, Berenice, and the high
priest Caiphas. This display of pedantic knowledge is
further seen in the part of the narrative which tells of
Dion’s meeting with Dionysius the Areopagite, who becomes
St. Denis, and brings Christianity to Gaul. But most
of the scene of Keon’s novel is laid in Rome, and in this part
of the story the characters of Tiberius, his brutal eunuch
Lygdus, and the wily Sejanus, are portrayed in such a way
as to show the author’s indefatigable search for details.
The only really good scene in the novel is that in which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
young Paulus, of the Æmelian family, subdues the famous
“Sejan horse” in the amphitheatre. The story of this
vicious horse became a tradition, so that Mr. E. L. White
would have done well to give the name “Sejanus” to a similar
animal in <i>Andivius Hedulio</i> (1921), a novel of the time
of Commodus; (instead he turns the name into Selinus).
In Keon’s novel Paulus was directed how to overcome the
horse by the sibyl of Cumæ, and as the title suggests, the
magic spells of such witches appear prominently in the
story; the use of a “love-philtre” suggests <i>The Last Days
of Pompeii</i> (1834). The mention of a famous acrostic,
whose initial letters spell the Greek word for fish, remind
one of the use made of this symbol of the early Christians,
which appears in later novels of Roman life, notably in
<i>Darkness and Dawn</i> (1892), and <i>Quo Vadis</i>. But <i>Dion and
the Sibyls</i> is mentioned at this point as an example of
pedanticism in the novel of Roman life.</p>

<p>Another example of pedanticism in the novel of Roman
life is seen in <i>The Money God; or The Empire and the
Papacy</i> (1873). It is needless to mention the various matters
of detail which the author, M. A. Quinton, mentions in
order to display his pedantic knowledge; but it is sufficient
to say that he is very learned indeed, and has read extensively
in the works of the Latin authors.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In some instances
he is very inaccurate in the deductions which he
makes from his reading, and there are some notable mistakes
in topography. The one redeeming feature of the
novel is its remarkable handling of a chariot-race scene; the
details of this scene are so similar to the details of a scene
in <i>Ben Hur</i> (1880), that it seems possible that Lew Wallace
may have known of Quinton’s work. While the scene of
the <i>Money God</i> is partly laid in Rome, it does not portray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Roman life, but rather presents certain details of Roman
life in an arbitrary manner, and in confused order. A
Roman marriage ceremony is described, and the methods
of Roman money-lenders are explained in this arbitrary
way. Quinton also wrote <i>Aurelia: or the Jews of Capena
Gate</i>, a few years before <i>The Money God</i>, but I have been
unable to obtain this book. In <i>Dion and the Sibyls</i>, and in
<i>The Money God</i> we have two very pedantic novels, which,
nevertheless, mention some of the things which are mentioned
in <i>Ben Hur</i>. But before considering <i>Ben Hur</i> itself,
let us retrace our steps to the year 1843, and from that time
follow the course of the popular melodramatic novel of
Roman life. This kind of novel represents the class in
which <i>Ben Hur</i> more properly belongs.</p>

<h3 id="III_E">E. NOVELS WRITTEN BY SO-CALLED “POPULAR” NOVELISTS,
WHO RELY ON THE MELODRAMATIC FOR THEIR APPEAL;
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE “POPULAR” NOVEL OF
ROMAN LIFE FROM 1843 TO THE PRESENT DAY</h3>

<p>As has been said, the growing insistence upon thoroughness
of scholarship, which is seen in the work of both German
and English scholars, resulted not only in a somewhat
direct imitation of the methods which appear in Becker’s
<i>Gallus</i> (1838), by a few pedantic novelists; but more especially
in an attempted exhibition of scholarship by “popular”
novelists, who wrote novels of Roman life after this
date. These “popular” novelists were men who either turned
out novels by the score, or produced a few novels of the
made-to-order variety; who sought for material with the
idea of obtaining “grist for the mill,” rather than of writing
a masterpiece. Such novelists have in most cases relied
for their appeal upon the use of melodramatic material; but
even these “popular” novelists soon came to realize the
necessity of sound scholarship to any author who intends
to attempt a novel of Roman life. In the class of “popular”
novelists, we shall also include those novelists whose principal
desire seems to have been to tell a “rattling good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
story” or to present a series of gorgeous pictures from the
life of the past,—though in some cases a more serious purpose
seems to underlie work of this description. We shall
begin our review of the “popular,” melodramatic novel of
Roman life with the novel of Ellen Pickering, which appeared
in 1843; but the “gorgeous romance,” which is a direct
development of the “popular” novel, did not reach its
height until considerably later. After 1843 all true novels
of Roman life make at least some pretense of thorough
scholarship.</p>

<p>Ellen Pickering, an American authoress, who turned out
a score of “popular” novels, wrote as one of the last of them,
<i>Julia of Baiae; or the Days of Nero</i> (1843). She clearly
shows her realization both of the necessity for thorough
scholarship in matters of history, and of her own shortcomings
in such matters. This is plain from the diffidence of
her preface to the novel, and from the fact that it was published
anonymously. The story of the death of Burrus, and
the appearance of Vespasian in the Praetorian guards, are
matters introduced not in strictly historical order. But
otherwise the book has no great faults. It is, however, not
even intended as a great novel, and is only cited here in
illustration of the fact that a reasonable display of scholarship
was coming to be demanded even of popular novelists.
<i>Julia of Baiae</i> appeared two years after the last of the Rev.
Ware’s novels (<i>Julian</i>, 1841), and was dedicated to the Rev.
Fred. J. Goodwin, M. A., Rector of St. George’s Church,
Flushing, N. Y. Yet, while it contains a story of the martyrs,
it is not to be considered a story of religious instruction,
but as an attempt at a popular novel with a rather
feeble essay at classical scholarship.</p>

<p>Wilkie Collins, who wrote <i>Antonina</i> in 1850, is a curious
example of a novelist possessed of rather high talents, yet
turning out novels which were made to the order of the
popular taste, and did not have the stamp of permanence.
Collins belongs to the school of Dickens rather than that of
Scott; and he develops the melodramatic side of Dickens,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
while dispensing with Dickens’ humor. In fact, in <i>Antonina</i>,
Collins goes back somewhat toward the style of the
Gothic romancers, who preceded Scott. Bleak mountainsides,
dark caverns and rushing torrents suggest the
“Gothic” terror. The labyrinth motive appears as one of
the principal motives of the story, in that its chief character,
a priest of Serapis, spends his life in digging a secret
passage through the walls of Rome, that he may thwart the
Christians by letting in the pagan invaders. This motive
is also used in a description of the secret passages under the
temple of Serapis. Another “Gothic” element is shown in
the ghastly scene at the banquet where guests and host resolve
to die before leaving their couches. While the story
describes the siege and sack of Rome by the Goths in 410
A. D., the invaders are made to appear less like the real
Goths than like the characters of the “Gothic” romancers.
In fact, the few historical characters of <i>Antonina</i> are not
very well done, and its history is not very good. But in
writing this, his first novel, Collins realized that he must be
fairly accurate in matters of history,—and in his descriptions
of Roman life in <i>Antonina</i> he sometimes achieves fine
realistic effect.</p>

<p>It would be unfair to brand the excellent work of Henry
W. Herbert as that of a “popular novelist,” since he displays
a profound scholarship not usually found in the “popular
novelist.” But it may be fair to consider that one of his
aims was to tell a “rattling good story,” and in this he was
certainly successful. His one important novel was called
<i>The Roman Traitor; or Days of Cicero, Cato, and Catiline</i>,
and was published in Philadelphia in 1853. It is a powerful
story of the conspiracy of Catiline against the Roman republic
in 63 B. C. The character of Catiline is portrayed
with masterful strokes, while those of Lentulus, Cethegus,
and other conspirators, are also well-done. Cicero, Cato,
and the young Julius Caesar, also appear in a natural light,
though of these three, only Cicero is made to play an important
part. Scenes in the Senate and in the houses of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
nobility are life-like, yet not over-done. The author has
succeeded admirably in portraying real men and women,
their thoughts, desires and passions. Scenes of politics,
luxury, and intrigue, ring true to life. Speeches assigned
to Cicero, Caesar, and Cato, are literal translations from
the works of Cicero and Sallust. Yet the author makes
them seem as real as though the words were being spoken
today. He also shows a thorough knowledge of the topography
of ancient Rome. Certain “Gothic” elements appear
in the story, especially near the end, where the scene is a
dark, dismal recess, overlooking a fearful chasm. But the
general style surpasses that of any Gothic romance and is
suggestive of Scott. Fine as it is in its portrayal of Roman
life, <i>The Roman Traitor</i> is even finer in its telling of a remarkable
story. It is also the only really effective handling
of the conspiracy of Catiline in the form of fiction.</p>

<p>The chief aim of Major G. J. Whyte-Melville in <i>The Gladiators</i>
(1863), is obviously to present a “gorgeous romance,”
replete with hair-raising episodes. Whyte-Melville, who is
the first of the brilliantly sensational writers of the
“gorgeous romance” of Roman life in English, is well known
for his novels of sporting life in England. In <i>The Gladiators</i>
he portrays the brilliant and corrupt society of
ancient Rome in the first century, A. D., in a way which
suggests his knowledge of a similar brilliant sporting society
in modern England. In his use of history in <i>The
Gladiators</i>, Whyte-Melville is fairly accurate. While not a
man of profound scholarship, he fortunately found his historical
material in a compact and readily accessible form,
in the work of the Jewish historian Josephus. There is not
much genuine history in the first part of <i>The Gladiators</i>,
in which portion the scene is laid in Rome; but in the latter
part of the novel, the author followed Josephus, in his wish
to find plenty of exciting and romantic episodes. It is interesting
to note, for example, that the story of the secret
passage through the walls of Jerusalem (which illustrates
the labyrinth motive), was taken by Whyte-Melville from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Josephus. Many other instances could be cited of Whyte-Melville’s
indebtedness to Josephus. Croly, it will be recalled,
followed Josephus to some extent, but made a more
scholarly and imaginative use of his material. The latter
part of <i>The Gladiators</i>, in which the author relies more on
the guidance of history, is better than the first part of the
story, and contains some really fine descriptions of episodes
in the siege of Jerusalem. However, that part of the story
which deals with life at Rome and the defeat of Vitellius is
accurate in its portrayal of some characteristic scenes of
Roman times. In general, <i>The Gladiators</i>, while it has an
impossible plot, and consists mainly of a series of gorgeous
scenes, may be said to portray Roman life very well in most
of its scenes. It lacks unity in its story and probability in
some of its details, and this is what prevents its having a
completeness of realistic effect.</p>

<p>It would be absurd as well as unfair to call <i>Ben Hur</i>
(1880), Gen. Lew Wallace’s great novel of Roman life,
“merely a popular” novel. A gorgeous romance it certainly
is,—but this is not all. <i>Ben Hur</i> has been and still is “popular”
in the best sense of the word. Some of the finest
novels of Roman life, even such great works as Kingsley’s
<i>Hypatia</i> and Canon Farrar’s <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>, make
their strongest appeal to the cultured few; <i>Ben Hur</i> appeals
with equal power to all. Moreover, some novels of Roman
life interest every one for a time, yet later lose their power
to interest; <i>Ben Hur</i> has become a permanent thing, appealing
to the popular taste of all time. <i>Ben Hur</i> is the first
novel of Roman life in English which has with uniform success
combined a high seriousness and sincerity of tone, with
a use of the sensational achieving the utmost in realistic
effect. Such a combination was only partly attempted in
<i>Hypatia</i>,—which only makes a limited use of the sensational,—and
was only equalled in isolated parts of <i>Salathiel</i>.
<i>Ben Hur</i> has been called a romance, but as one reads it, his
feeling is not, “This is romance,” but “This is life!”</p>

<p><i>Ben Hur</i> is so universally known, that it is needless to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
review it here. It has never ceased to be sold in English-speaking
countries; while it has been translated into
French, German, Bohemian, Swedish, Turkish, Spanish,
Portuguese and Arabic, and printed in raised letters for the
blind. Its dramatization has also increased its popularity.
Hence we need now only consider a few points about <i>Ben
Hur</i> in regard to its relation to our subject. In the first
place, <i>Ben Hur</i> is definitely a novel of Roman life, though
its scene only goes to the city of Rome in occasional brief
explanatory paragraphs. Other novels of Roman life so
far considered have deserved to be called such, either because
their scene was laid (at least in part) in Rome, or because
it was laid chiefly in some great city of the Empire,
(as Alexandria in <i>Hypatia</i>), in which life very strongly
resembled the life of Rome. But from <i>Ben Hur</i>, more than
from any other novel, one gets a sense of other related parts
of the Roman world. Other novelists, as Croly in <i>Salathiel</i>,
have successfully carried their characters to different parts
of the Roman world, and have described scenes, which were
of deep significance, but which none the less were associated
in one’s mind with a definitely limited place. But in <i>Ben
Hur</i> from the beginning of the story, when the three “wise
men,” representing the antiquity of Egypt, the learning of
the East, and the culture of Greece, meet and pursue the
common purpose of their lives, one perceives that the important
events and even minor episodes of the story are to
be of such tremendous significance, that they throw off the
limitations of time and place. The events of <i>Ben Hur</i> are
accurately assigned by the author to different historical
places, but they really belong not so much to separate, individual
parts of the Roman world, as to the whole of that
world. Christ was born in Palestine (the scene of most of
<i>Ben Hur</i>), but His message was to the whole world,—and
the world was then Roman. Ben Hur was a Jew, but the
message he received was for Jew and Gentile, Roman
master and Roman slave. That the entire world was
Roman in the time of Christ is shown by Wallace with great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
care and fidelity. Wherever the story takes one, he meets
with characteristic Roman scenes. Scenes in Palestine
show the unmistakable marks of the Roman oppressor, and
the bitter hatred with which Rome’s power is regarded.
We meet with Roman soldiers, a Roman slave-gang, we
witness the departure of a Roman galley, and a Roman fight
at sea; we behold the conclusion of a Roman all-night revel,
while the Romans take precedence over all other celebrants
in the Grove of Daphne. Even the chariot-race scene,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the
most famous in <i>Ben Hur</i>, could have been transferred to
Rome, and is characteristic of the Roman world.</p>

<p>How then does <i>Ben Hur</i> show the coming of Christ into
the world, the material part of which was under Roman
sway? The novel is called in its alternative title <i>A Tale of
the Christ</i>;—and such it is. The figure of Christ appears
when he is a babe worshipped by the Magi, and later in
scenes near the time of the Crucifixion; but these scenes
are based on Scripture rather than created by Wallace. We
have spoken of the fact that no novel of Roman life can be
successful, if it makes Christ the central figure or character.
<i>Ben Hur</i> does not do so; but its author shows enough of the
life and death of the lowly Nazarene to convince one of His
Divine Influence upon the Roman world, which has become
the world of today. Ben Hur as he listened to the preaching
of Jesus, and gazed upon His wonderful countenance,
remembered having seen Him before. “That the look so
calm, so pitiful, so loving, had somewhere in the past beamed
upon him as that moment it was beaming on Balthazar,
became an assurance. Faintly at first, at last a clear light,
a burst of sunshine, the scene by the well at Nazareth what
time the Roman guard was dragging him to the galleys
returned, and all his being thrilled.” This quotation is
typical of the story of <i>Ben Hur; a Tale of the Christ</i>. The
mother and sister of Ben Hur suffered misfortune at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
hands of the Romans, and were only freed from the cruelty
of the Roman world by their acceptance of and meeting with
The Master. Lew Wallace is equally great in his portrayal
of the material life of Rome and the spiritual life of Christ.</p>

<p>Having chosen his subject, Wallace wisely refrained from
making any very great use of Roman history, or of Roman
historical characters not important in the Bible story. But
just as the scenes of his novel are typical of life in the
Roman world, so his characters exhibit the variety of race,
creed and nationality to be found in the people Rome ruled.
Beside a number of different types of Hebrew character
which the author portrays, there are at least two kinds of
Romans in <i>Ben Hur</i>, the proud, cruel oppressor, in Messala,
and the magnanimous benefactor, in Quintus Arrius. Other
characters represent the sage of whatever nationality, the
youthful Greek with his perfect physical beauty, the Arab
sheik, the seductive siren of the Nile, the devout Christian,
and the pagan priestess. But Wallace does not rely too
much on atmosphere or local color. His knowledge of
Roman history was sound. While Messala, an imaginary
character, is important in the story, Sejanus, who controlled
the politics of Rome, is given his proper place in the background.
In fact, the scholarship of Wallace was sound in
every way. While he did not finish his schooling according
to the prescribed course, he completed his own education
more thoroughly than most men do. He was a great reader
of good books, and at the age of 19, had read every book in
his father’s library,—700 standard works. He continued
to be a great reader and student, and formed a large library
of his own. Besides his reading Wallace had a rich experience
of life on the battlefield and in public life, and was
peculiarly well fitted to understand with sympathy all sorts
and conditions of men. <i>Ben Hur</i> is the only other novel of
Roman life, besides <i>Salathiel</i>, to arouse successfully the
reader’s sympathy for a Jewish hero. In his presentation
of Ben Hur as a slave, Wallace showed his realization of
antiquity of the slavery question; and he had shortly before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
done his part in settling forever that question. His sympathetic
understanding of men, women, and little children of
the present aided him in portraying with sympathy various
types of character seen in the life of the past. <i>Ben Hur</i> is
a novel which voices the hopes and aspirations of the common
people of all the world.</p>

<p>Any estimate of the absolute value of Ben Hur must place
Lew Wallace’s novel very high indeed. If one discounts the
great influence the book has had upon its many readers, and
considers it simply as a piece of art, it still ranks very high.
While <i>Ben Hur</i> is said to have brought its author more sudden
fame than any other novel has brought to an American
author, this fame which came suddenly, did not as suddenly
depart. If he is judged by the merits of <i>Ben Hur</i>, Wallace
deserves to be ranked, as a novelist, with other great American
novelists, such as Cooper, Hawthorne and Howells. In
the opinion of a noted authority on American literature, <i>Ben
Hur</i> “is in every respect a great novel.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> And it is impossible
to differ with this opinion. Reduced to its lowest
terms, all adverse criticism of <i>Ben Hur</i> lies in an arraignment
of its so-called “faulty syntax.” Those who make this
criticism in every case fail to give any quotation in illustration
of their view, or to be specific in any other way. If one
were to go through <i>Ben Hur</i> hunting for irregularities of
syntax, doubtless he could find them just as easily as they
may be found in the work of almost any other great novelist,—and
perhaps no more easily. It is doubtful if the
great majority of reviewers who have criticised the syntax
of <i>Ben Hur</i> have had any thorough appreciation of what
syntax is. Moreover, to quote a recent work on style, by
a classical scholar, who is speaking of the style of Sophocles,
it seems “that liberties of this kind are not confined to any
particular stage of literary history, but are mainly due to
the individual bent of the writer’s genius. No ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
author, however, has carried them to a greater length than
Sophocles, ... he rejoices in those confusions of <i>syntax</i>
... by which one construction is suddenly merged in
another.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Sophocles has not perished on account of irregularities
of style or syntax, nor will Lew Wallace, for any
such reason. The free style of <i>Ben Hur</i> is well suited to
describe its ever-changing scenes. Nor is the novel to be
criticised for looseness of construction. Its combination of
unity and variety make <i>Ben Hur</i> in every sense a great
novel suited to a portrayal of life in the Roman Empire in
the time of Christ. The chariot race, the sea fight, and the
disentombing of Ben Hur’s mother and sister, are thrilling
episodes in the world’s literature; and considered as a whole,
<i>Ben Hur</i> is one of the great novels of all time.</p>

<p>After the appearance of <i>Ben Hur</i> many “popular” novels
of Roman life tend toward a greater or less imitation of
Lew Wallace’s great novel. There is, however, little such
imitation in John W. Graham’s <i>Neaera</i> (1886), a novel
the author of which displays genuine scholarship. In its
description of the splendor and crime of the court of Tiberius,
<i>Neaera</i> depends much on the <i>Annals</i> of Tacitus, which
furnishes the best source for such a description of the Rome
of Tiberius. The character of the gloomy Emperor is well
drawn, as are also those of Sejanus, his mistress Livia, and
Lygdus, the eunuch. Domitius Afer is made prominent,
and through him we learn of the methods of the Emperor
and others who make use of the ruffians of the Subura to
attain their ends. The banquet of Apicius, and his suicide
furnish the material for a realistic description of manners.</p>

<p>An example of a very poor kind of “popular” historical
novel is found in <i>The Son of a Star</i> (1888), by B. W. Richardson.
This is a wildly fantastic romance which bears on
the title page a quotation from Horace, “Ficta voluptatis
causa sit proxima veris,” but is certainly very far from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
truth in most respects. While <i>The Son of a Star</i> makes occasional
brief displays of accurate scholarship, chiefly borrowed
from other novelists, its loose construction and false
atmosphere make it a good example of the novel of Roman
life “gone to seed.” The bright, though false, coloring of
this romance suggests the work of Sir Rider Haggard,
which has already been excluded from consideration in this
study. His <i>Cleopatra</i> appeared in the following year
(1889). This date, in fact, may be said to mark the point
at which the pretended novel of Roman life, with its artificial
coloring, becomes separated from the true novel of
Roman life.</p>

<p>The idea of presenting the life of Rome as a gorgeous
and at times bloody spectacle, with a frequent use of the
sensational, reached its greatest height in <i>Quo Vadis</i>
(1895), by the Polish author, H. Sienkiewicz. This idea
had appeared in the English novel of Roman life, <i>e. g.</i>, in
<i>Salathiel</i> (1827), <i>The Gladiators</i> (1863), and <i>Ben Hur</i>
(1880). There is no need to review <i>Quo Vadis</i> in detail
here, since it is so well known; but let us establish its relation
to the English novel of Roman life. It appeared after
Eckstein’s <i>Nero</i> (1889), and a number of English novels of
Roman life of the time of Nero, and may owe some of its
inspiration to these, especially to <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>
(1892). But after <i>Quo Vadis</i> was translated into English
(1896), its influence upon later English novels of Roman
life overshadowed even that of Canon Farrar’s great and
more serious work. <i>Quo Vadis</i> has been translated and
read in civilized lands even more widely than <i>Ben Hur</i>.
These are the two novels of Roman life which have had the
most widespread influence upon all subsequent novels of
Roman life the world over. <i>Quo Vadis</i> adds practically no
new element to the novel of Roman life, but puts certain
elements which already existed into a more intensely vivid,
and even lurid form,—in short, emphasizes the sensational.
In its larger outlines <i>Quo Vadis</i> is reminiscent not only of
<i>Darkness and Dawn</i> but of <i>Hypatia</i>. It represents the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
same struggle between the Christian Church and the Roman
pagan world, the same triumph of Christianity. The contrast
lies between the proud, voluptuous, and cruel spirit of
pagan Rome and the spirit of humility and hope of the
dwellers in the catacombs. A personal contrast is seen between
Nero, the royal performer in the circus, and St.
Peter, the fisherman who was to rule the world by his example.
Other characters are those familiar to the novel of
Roman life, Petronius the connoisseur in luxury, Vinicius
the active young Roman noble, Lygia the beautiful Christian
maiden condemned to the arena, Ursus the powerful slave,
the dissolute Poppæa and members of Nero’s court, Croton
the athlete, Glaucus the forgiving Christian, and others too
numerous to mention. The scenes of <i>Quo Vadis</i> are also
familiar, much the same as those of <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>,
the picture of the fire at Rome being especially fine. While
the moral lesson exists in <i>Quo Vadis</i>, what Sienkiewicz did
for the novel of Roman life was to portray the life of the
city of Rome itself in a form absolutely irresistible to the
so-called “average” reader. Realistic effect was the most
important thing to the writer of <i>Quo Vadis</i>; and in preparation
for the writing of a novel which should portray the life
of Rome with realistic effect he traveled widely and made a
thorough study of numerous Latin authors, especially those
who describe the life of Rome of the first few centuries
A. D. The result is that Sienkiewicz was a profound
scholar; and his scholarship appears in <i>Quo Vadis</i>,—though
the novel shows some instances of error, chiefly topographical
error, especially in the description of the great fire.
None the less <i>Quo Vadis</i> is now the novel of Roman life
which shows to the greatest extent a combination of careful
scholarship and popularity of appeal. By 1900, nearly
2,000,000 copies of the English translation (1896), by Jeremiah
Curtin, had been sold; and the influence of the novel
upon popular taste is still important, since it creates beyond
a doubt in every reader’s mind a desire to read further in
Roman historical fiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p><i>The Sign of the Cross</i>, by Wilson Barrett, appeared immediately
after <i>Quo Vadis</i>, and, though very popular, is
nothing but a weak and slavish imitation of Sienkiewicz’s
great novel. This is all that need be said of <i>The Sign of the
Cross</i> as a novel, since there is nothing original about it,
and its brief popularity was due entirely to the reflected
splendor of <i>Quo Vadis</i>. The fact that this novel was turned
into a play with some success, following the example set by
the dramatization of <i>Ben Hur</i>, shows that theatrical managers
realized the possibilities offered by a novel of Roman
life. Unfortunately the drama of Roman life presented
either on the stage or the screen, has in nearly every instance,
become more a gorgeous spectacle or a sensational
melodrama, than a serious drama. But the drama of
Roman life is mentioned here, since it has induced many
who have seen such a play to read the novel on which it was
based. This was the case with <i>Ben Hur</i>, which in the form
of a novel offers, I believe, a higher and stronger appeal
than any dramatic production based upon it.</p>

<p>Another novel which definitely goes back to <i>Quo Vadis</i>
for its best scenes, but is possessed of some individual merit,
is <i>Amor Victor</i>, the third edition of which appeared in 1902.
This novel, by Orr Kenyon, is also marked by the seriousness
of purpose which underlies the sensationalism of <i>Quo
Vadis</i>. It particularly resembles <i>Quo Vadis</i> in its scenes in
the arena, and in showing the tremendous difference between
the appalling difficulties presented to the Christian
at the time of the Empire, and those which he now meets.
But <i>Amor Victor</i> also shows the similarity of atrocities
committed by pagans then and now. This novel seems to be
the first to draw parallels between events in the past and
definite, specific occurrences of the present, taken sometimes
even from personal experiences. For example, the
author, in describing certain almost unthinkable atrocities
which occurred in the Roman arena, shows how exactly the
same outrages were committed upon the Christians by the
Turks shortly before he wrote. Even since <i>Amor Victor</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
was written, these scenes have been repeated in Turkey.
Moreover, Kenyon, in describing the scene in which Arsaces,
the giant Parthian, kills a lion in the arena, is recalling
the time when he himself had seen Sandow, the famous
strong man, throw a lion in a public exhibition. This
definite use of an incident, which the author has seen with
his own eyes, aids him in achieving realistic effect. A similar
use of an incident which actually occurred, is made by
Mr. E. L. White in <i>Andivius Hedulio</i> (1921), in which the
description of the miraculous escape of Commodus’ chariot
from disaster was suggested by a real accident in the streets
of Baltimore. <i>Amor Victor</i> takes its story of St. John the
Apostle from the patristic writings. It is accurate in its
historical coloring. In speaking of his serious purpose, the
author says in a note at the end of <i>Amor Victor</i>, “Newell
Dwight Hillis has shown that really great works of fiction
are those which illustrate some vital principle, some deep
moral lesson.” The novel conveys a moral lesson. Yet,
while parts of it are also written in juvenile style, <i>Amor
Victor</i> is not merely a story of religious instruction, but a
true novel of Roman life. <i>The Story of Phaedrus</i>, by Hillis,
to which Kenyon has reference in his quotation, is more a
story of religious instruction written in distinctly juvenile
style. Its hero does not see much of Roman life, since he
spends most of his life in copying sacred writings in the
depths of the catacombs.</p>

<p>An imitation of <i>Ben Hur</i> with some original touches is
Mr. Irving Bacheller’s <i>Vergilius; A Tale of the Coming of
Christ</i> (1904). The author reverses the plan of Lew Wallace,
by placing the birth of Christ at the end, instead of at
the beginning of his story. Mr. Bacheller’s attempt to use
the birth of Christ as a climax, to which the rest of the story
leads, is not very successful. His treatment of sacred
scenes falls far below that of Lew Wallace, and the construction
of his plot is poor. But he has described some
scenes in Roman life with fine realistic effect, particularly
those which take place in the magnificent palaces of Rome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
and Jerusalem. The descriptions of intrigues which take
place in the court of Augustus, show the uncertainty of life
at Rome at the time. The characters are few in number,
Augustus and the young Jewish prince Herod Antipater being
the only important historical figures. The crafty
nature of Augustus is portrayed with a very keen insight
into the depths of human nature, and the vindictive hatred
of the Jewish prince forms a marked contrast to the noble,
ingenuous nature of Vergilius, the imaginary hero of the
story. Vergilius is a young patrician, and a favorite of
Augustus; his character is not idealized and is quite representative
of Roman times. In justice to Mr. Bacheller’s
work, it should be said that he has not attempted to fill as
large a canvas as did Lew Wallace in <i>Ben Hur</i>; his picture
of life in Roman times is more limited in its scope, and more
chaste in its outlines. Scenes which make use of the sensational
are not overdone. <i>Vergilius</i> is a novel of Roman life,
containing many beautifully written passages, which give
it a very high position among such novels.</p>

<p><i>Lux Crucis</i> (1904) is a very readable novel by Mr.
Samuel M. Gardenhire. It is called by its author <i>A Tale of
the Great Apostle</i>, and is dedicated to the Rt. Rev. Ethelbert
Talbot, Bishop of Central Pennsylvania. <i>Lux Crucis</i> is,
more than any other novel I know of, an attempt to portray
Roman life by taking as much material as possible from
previous novels of Roman life. Everything is thus taken
at second-hand, without recourse to original sources. This
method may show wide reading, but hardly shows thorough
scholarship. Scenes in the arena depend upon <i>Quo Vadis</i>;
scenes which have to do with St. Paul and Christian characters
suggest <i>Ben Hur</i> and <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>; while
other passages, especially that representing the gladiator’s
school, undoubtedly go back to <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i>.
The author takes his history, chronology, and topography
at second hand, and apparently he is confused in his remembrance
of his own reading. The result is that <i>Lux Crucis</i>
probably contains more ridiculous mistakes than any other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
novel of Roman life. For example, a so-called Briton is
given the Anglo-Saxon name of Ethelred, though he lives
in the time of Nero, before the Saxon invasion of Britain;
he is made to come from Brittany, though Armorica did not
receive that name until at least six hundred years later;
and he speaks of crossing the channel to Angle-land, “with
a smile.” (The reader also smiles.) An anachronism
which is related to topography occurs, when the Forum of
Trajan is mentioned in this story of Nero’s time, though the
accession of Trajan did not take place until thirty-three
years later. These typical instances of error in <i>Lux Crucis</i>
are selected from a great number, some of which are almost
equally bad. It is remarkable that, in spite of these inconsistencies,
the novel is pleasing in its portrayal of characters,
historical and non-historical, and many of its scenes
are by no means devoid of realistic effect. <i>Lux Crucis</i>
furnishes examples of the pitfalls awaiting an author who
has attempted a piece of work requiring scholarship, but
has been handicapped by his unscholarly methods.</p>

<p>Mr. Walter S. Cramp’s popular novel, <i>Psyche</i> (1905),
describes the Rome of Tiberius, and contains much sound
history taken from the <i>Annals</i> of Tacitus. In this it resembles
Graham’s <i>Neaera</i>, which had appeared in 1886. In
1913 Mr. Cramp published another novel of Roman life,
called <i>An Heir to Empire</i>, which is much like <i>Psyche</i> in its
general outlines, except that the story centers in the life of
Augustus’ court, instead of in the life of the court of Tiberius.
It makes no great misuse of history, but adds too
many fanciful details to historical episodes; this in spite of
the fact that the novel is formally dedicated “To the Honorable
Rodolpho Lanciani, whose genius touched the dust
and ruins of Ancient Rome and made them live.”</p>

<h3 id="III_F">F. INFLUENCE OF FRENCH NOVELS OF ROMAN LIFE</h3>

<p>Hitherto no mention has been made of the influence of
French novels of Roman life upon English novels of Roman
life. And I have found that this influence of French novels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
is not nearly so important as might be supposed, but on the
whole, is rather an indefinite thing. But before concluding
our survey of the “popular novel” of Roman life and the
“gorgeous romance,” it is best to say a few words, (regarding
the latter phrase especially), of the influence of certain
French novels. In 1862 Gustave Flaubert’s famous
<i>Salammbo</i> appeared in the English translation. While this
great work undoubtedly had a tremendous influence as a
“gorgeous romance,” it is difficult to trace this influence
directly. <i>The Gladiators</i> (1863) appeared the following
year, and exhibits a similarity of style in presenting the
gorgeous pageantry of the past; but while <i>The Gladiators</i>
may owe something to <i>Salammbo</i>, it seems more likely that
Whyte-Melville’s novel was an independent effort to please
a certain element of the public taste. Later and greater
novels, such as <i>Ben Hur</i> and <i>Quo Vadis</i>, may have profited
by the splendid example of Flaubert, who filled a large
canvas with brilliant colors, but did not sacrifice truth,—but
here again the influence is indefinite. In fact, <i>Salammbo</i>
appears to have stood forth with such tremendous power
that it discouraged rather than encouraged imitation. No
one,—so novelists have thought,—could hope to equal Flaubert’s
novel in splendor of style or in realistic effect. Thus
<i>Salammbo</i> has remained the only great novel whose scene is
ancient Carthage. Though its scene does not go to Rome,
no view of Roman life would be complete without some
knowledge of the most powerful enemy of the Roman Republic,
whose life was so closely connected with that of
Rome. <i>Salammbo</i> combines the story of a Carthaginian
princess, a sister of Hannibal, with an account of the Mercenary
War. The description of this war of Carthage with
her own soldiers, suggests troubles Rome later had with
armies composed of heterogeneous elements. <i>Salammbo</i> is
equally vivid in its description of the pagan customs of
Carthage, particularly of the custom of offering human sacrifices
to Moloch. A few books which describe the city life
of Carthage, or her wars with the Romans, no doubt owe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
their inspiration indirectly to <i>Salammbo</i>. G. A. Henty’s
excellent book for boys, <i>The Young Carthaginian</i> (1886),
describes the political organization and social conditions existing
in the city of Carthage, and gives a similar description
of the sacrifice to Moloch, before taking Hannibal on
his campaign against Rome. <i>The Lion’s Brood</i> (1901) has
its scene entirely in the Italian peninsula. Recently Señor
Blasco Ibañez published <i>Sonnica</i> (1920), which seems to
show evidence of his reading of <i>Salammbo</i>. In this novel
Hannibal’s siege of the semibarbaric city of Saguntum recalls
Flaubert’s description of the siege of Carthage by the
Mercenaries. <i>Sonnica</i>, besides giving a good characterization
of Hannibal, is especially noteworthy for its accurate
portrayal of the stern, bare, and crude city of Rome in the
early days of the republic. This portrayal contains a fine
paragraph on the Roman father, and mentions several historical
characters, such as the vindictive Cato and the slave
Plautus. <i>Sonnica</i> does not appear as yet to have influenced
novels of Roman life in English, though it may have given
some suggestions to Mr. Jaquelin A. Caskie, who has written
<i>Nabala</i> (1922), an attractive novelette, dealing with the
Third Punic War. More likely <i>Nabala</i>, (as everything else
in fiction connected with Hannibal and Carthage before her
fall seems to do), goes back for its principal inspiration to
<i>Salammbo</i>. Its scenes of fighting outside the city of Carthage
recall similar scenes in <i>Salammbo</i>, as does its description
of what goes on inside the city, the human sacrifice to
Moloch furnishing the climax of the story.</p>

<p>A novel written in quite different style by Flaubert is
<i>The Temptation of St. Anthony</i> (1874). This has for its
scene the cell of an anchorite in the time of Constantine,
since St. Anthony says in the novel, “The Emperor Constantine
has written me three letters.” In describing the
visions<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which pass through the mind of the saint, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the author makes it seem as though the entire pageant of
the past history of the Roman Empire were passing before
his eyes. In his temptation the saint sees pagan gods pass
before him, and he takes on the personality of famous kings,
with their unlimited power to gratify their passions. In
his mental wanderings, he speaks of Athanasius, the Arians,
and the monks of Nitria. This last thought recalls the part
which the savage monks of Nitria play in Kingsley’s
<i>Hypatia</i>, and the talk of other affairs of the Church also
suggests <i>Hypatia</i>. Moreover, the situation of St. Anthony
alone in his cell in the desert is strongly reminiscent of
passages at the beginning and the end of Kingsley’s novel.
But St. Anthony’s strongest temptation comes in the form
of the vision of Thais, an irresistibly beautiful courtesan.
This suggests M. Anatole France’s (Jacques Anatole France
Thibault) <i>Thais</i> (1889), which also makes a portrayal of
the beautiful courtesan. Custom forbids English and
American novelists from making such a portrayal in detail,
and it is to be doubted whether they could present such a
picture with the realism of French authors, whose view-point
has always been radically different, as regards the
degree of frankness to be allowed a novelist in portraying
a man’s passion for a beautiful woman. The portrayal of
the beautiful courtesan in the French novel of Roman life
reaches the greatest frankness in Pierre Louys’ <i>Aphrodite</i>,
which is, in effect, a description of the schools of
prostitution in Roman Alexandria. French novels of this
kind have had little effect on novels of Roman life written
in English. However, there is one novel written by an
American of French descent, which frankly tells the story
of a beautiful courtesan, and will now be discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. T. Everett Harré published in Philadelphia in 1916
<i>Behold the Woman</i>. This is the story of the famous Alexandrian
courtesan of transcendent beauty, who is known
in the <i>Lives of the Saints</i> as St. Mary of Egypt. Mr. Harré
takes the general outlines of his story from the <i>Lives of the
Saints</i>, though adding much from invention. And, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
<i>Behold the Woman</i> shows an individuality of style and a
remarkable power of description, it appears to be a book full
of echoes. There is, for example, some similarity of plot
between <i>Behold the Woman</i> and the <i>Thais</i> of M. Anatole
France, in that both novels portray the repentance and regeneration
of the fallen woman.</p>

<p>M. France in <i>Thais</i> had been said to combine “a curiously
subtle piety of imagination with impiety of thought.” (B.
W. Wells in <i>The Encyclopedia Americana</i>, 1920.) Whether
this criticism is just or not, as applied to <i>Thais</i>, it must be
said most emphatically that Mr. Harré’s work shows absolutely
no impiety of thought. In presenting the facts of life
in the Roman world, in <i>Behold the Woman</i>, he is making a
simple statement of the truth. Piety of imagination is indeed
displayed in the story of Mary’s conversion and life of
penitence in the desert. But even in such a scene as that
in which the supposed room of the Lord’s Supper is desecrated
by the orgy of the fallen monks, the author shows no
impiety of thought. Nor, if one sets aside questions of
religion, and rests his faith on mere morality, can the
charge of immorality be brought against <i>Behold the Woman</i>
with any sincerity whatever. In certain scenes of <i>Behold
the Woman</i> there appears evidence of a direct borrowing
from Pierre Louys’ <i>Aphrodite</i>, in which there had been an
elaborate description of the bath and toilet of the courtesan,
with an extensive catalogue of her charms in symbolic language.
In <i>Behold the Woman</i> the scenes attending the
destruction of the temple of Serapic remind one of Ebers’
<i>Serapis</i>, which had described similar scenes. But Mr.
Harré particularly excels in describing with minute touches
the superstition of the Roman soldiers, who were called
upon to destroy the temple and its huge idol, but feared to
do so. Moreover, the brutal conduct of the military on this
occasion and at the breaking up of the banquet at Mary’s
palace, well represents the ruthless use of Rome’s mighty
power. There also appear to be in <i>Behold the Woman</i>
some slight suggestions taken from Kingsley’s novel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
<i>Hypatia</i>, the same proper names being used, but transposed;
the name of Philammon, Kingsley’s hero, is given to
a character in <i>Behold the Woman</i>, who corresponds to one
of the minor characters in <i>Hypatia</i>. Moreover, the scenes
of riot in the streets of Alexandria, which appear in <i>Behold
the Woman</i>, are reminiscent of similar scenes in <i>Hypatia</i>.
The two books represent the savage monks in a similar way;
and Mary is able to see through their sham Christianity,
just as Philammon saw through the pretenses of the monks,
in <i>Hypatia</i>. But as Mr. Harré says in his preface, he does
not agree with Kingsley that “one who writes of such an
era ... cannot tell how evil people were.” Here he
is quoting the preface of <i>Hypatia</i>, though he does not say so.
In <i>Behold the Woman</i>, he does tell how evil people were;
and justly remarks in its preface that the novel is one for
strong men and fearless women, not for children. The
description of the orgy at the banquet in Mary’s palace is
perhaps as realistic a portrayal of such a scene as is made in
any novel of Roman life; but the frankness of this description
is certainly very nearly equaled in Canon Farrar’s
<i>Darkness and Dawn</i>, a novel which no one would think of
calling immoral in any sense of the word. The description
of Mary’s sordid life in the Brucheum, the slum quarter of
the city, is also realistic, and portrays a side of life which
has been neglected by the authors of novels of Roman life,
even when they claimed to be presenting life among all
classes of society.</p>

<p>Other scenes in <i>Behold the Woman</i> are similar to those
which are already familiar in the novel of Roman life. And
no matter what he is describing, the author’s genius and
originality have enabled him to portray scenes from life in
Roman times, with a vividness and realism hardly exceeded
in any novel of Roman life. The style of <i>Behold the Woman</i>
is richly ornamental at times, but never too flowery for the
theme which the author has in hand. <i>Behold the Woman</i>
could be placed in the class of the “gorgeous romance” along
with such novels as <i>Ben Hur</i> and <i>Quo Vadis</i>. But it shows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
more than any other novel of Roman life in English, the
influence of the French novels of which we have spoken.</p>

<h3 id="III_G">G. NOVELS WRITTEN BY TEACHERS OF ROMAN HISTORY OR OF
THE CLASSICS</h3>

<p>Some of the novels which have been mentioned were written
by school teachers or college professors. Charles Kingsley
at the time when he wrote <i>Hypatia</i> was a school teacher
very much in need of more pupils, whose fees would help
him make both ends meet.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The Rev. A. J. Church, M. A.,
to whose books for boys allusion has been made, was a Professor
of Latin at University College, London. But I wish
to consider now those novels which have been written by
teachers, who wished especially to illustrate certain periods
of Roman history, or to make the life of some great Roman
historical character stand out with particular vividness.
The word “novels,” as here used, is meant to apply in the
main to books which can be read with pleasure both by boys
and their elders; and it will be recalled, that in defining the
novel of Roman life, books written only for boys, or written
with a religious motive, were excluded. The work of the
Rev. A. J. Church is therefore excluded, practically for two
different reasons. But, since it often touches closely the
true novel of Roman life, the titles of some of his books will
be mentioned. His <i>Two Thousand Years Ago</i> (1885) has
been spoken of, as following Eckstein’s <i>Prusias</i> (1884),
which is also on the Spartacus theme; but Church’s book is
entirely a book for boys. <i>The Count of the Saxon Shore</i>
(1887) is a similar book on the period marking the end of
Roman control in Britain. <i>To the Lions</i> (1889) makes the
same use of the correspondence between Trajan and Pliny
that had been made in <i>Valerius</i>; but its scene is Bithynia,
and it is purely a religious story. <i>The Burning of Rome</i>
(1892), as has been said, follows Eckstein’s <i>Nero</i> (1889),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
but even this book by Church cannot be called a novel,
though it is his best book. <i>Lords of the World</i> (1898) describes
the fall of Carthage and Corinth. Finally, <i>The
Crown of Pine</i> (1905) tells of the banishment of the Jews
from Rome in the time of Claudius, of the preaching of St.
Paul, and of the Isthmian games at Corinth. The style of
this last book is characteristic of the Rev. Church’s work;
his thorough scholarship is greater than his power to interest
the reader, juvenile or otherwise.</p>

<p>A novel (for so it fully deserves to be called), written
before the Rev. Church’s books, is <i>Helena’s Household</i>
(1858). This is by James De Mille, Professor of Belles
Lettres at Dalhousie College, N. S. Though it has been catalogued
as a juvenile book, it hardly deserves this description.
And while it is dedicated to the Rev. John Pryor,
D. D., and shows some influence of the story of religious
instruction, it deserves to be classified as a novel of Roman
life. <i>Helena’s Household</i> has a very good historical background,
and contains some very fine descriptions of life at
Rome. The story of Boadicea’s defeat is told by a Briton
who was taken captive on that occasion. This same Briton
is made to fight in the arena, in a scene which is fairly well
done. This mention of a British slave, and the outline of
the siege and destruction of Jerusalem at the end of the
novel, suggest <i>The Gladiators</i> (1863), a novel which resembles
De Mille’s book in its rambling construction. Nero’s
atrocities are in the main passed over, though there is a
fine description of the great fire at Rome, which he is said
to have caused; and the buffoon Emperor is described as
acting at the games in Greece. Pomponia is not made a
very important character in the story, but her Christianity
is made the excuse for entirely too much religious talk, for
a novel of Roman life. St. Paul and St. Luke are represented
as prisoners, and a fine description is given of St.
Paul’s heroic death, though his martyrdom is not the central
theme of the story by any means. Moreover, the life
of the Christians is realistically described, without the false<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
element of terror, which is often added to such descriptions.
In spite of its rambling construction, and religious discussion,
<i>Helena’s Household</i> is a scholarly piece of work, which
both illustrates Roman history, and portrays well the life of
Rome. <i>The Martyr of the Catacombs</i>, (1858), by De Mille,
is more a religious story than a novel.</p>

<p>A fine illustration of Roman history is given in <i>Kallistratus;
an Autobiography</i> (1897), a novel dealing with the
campaigns of Hannibal against Rome. This is not to be
considered an imitation of Flaubert’s <i>Salammbo</i>, or any
other novel dealing with the Carthaginians, but is an independent
attempt to illustrate certain facts of Roman history.
The author of <i>Kallistratus</i> was Mr. A. H. Gilkes, M.
A., Master of Dulwich College, Dulwich, and the preface to
the novel is written from the College. <i>Kallistratus</i> need
not be considered a book for boys, and is infinitely better
than most books for boys. But its hero, Kallistratus, is a
typical boys’ hero, who serves as Hannibal’s aide and personal
attendant. Besides telling the story of the Second
Punic war from Hannibal’s point of view, <i>Kallistratus</i> presents
with a very realistic effect an account of the chicanery
of an ancient oracle, which is located on the banks of the
Rhone near Massilia, and is consulted by a Gallic chieftain.
Hannibal’s victories over the Romans are accurately described,
and attributed in part to Varro, the low-born consul,
as they should be. Moreover, the fact that Kallistratus’
brothers and sisters are sent to Rome under the protection
of the Scipios, affords the author an opportunity to describe
life at Rome to some extent. While the character of the
great Hannibal does not stand out with especial force in
this novel, <i>Kallistratus</i> gives a truly realistic account of his
campaigns from the point of view of one who was with him;
and it may well have served as a model in many ways for
Mr. Duffield Osborne, when he was writing <i>The Lion’s
Brood</i>, (1901), a novel which treats of the same period from
the Roman point of view. Mr. Gilkes’ other novel, <i>Four
Sons</i>, (1909), seems to lapse into more juvenile style,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
mainly because its subject is not so inspiring. But it illustrates
very faithfully the period of Roman history which
was marked by the inroads of the Greeks in Southern Italy
and the Samnite War. The author’s interest in books for
boys and the school life of boys, is shown not only by the
profession he has chosen, but also in the genuine book for
boys he has written, called <i>Boys and Masters</i>. But of the
books he has written, <i>Kallistratus</i> especially, would be of
interest to any intelligent reader, juvenile or otherwise.</p>

<p><i>A Friend of Caesar</i>, (1900), by William Stearns Davis, a
college professor, whose scholarly attainments have won for
him a well-deserved reputation, is the first and, in my opinion,
the only book which successfully illustrates with the
most minute detail every important event or incident in a
brief period of Roman history (50-47 B. C.), crowded with
important events,—and at the same time presents a fictitious
story of supreme interest, surpassing that of most historical
novels. It is in fact, the world’s best school-history
book in the form of fiction. Mr. Davis was well qualified to
write such a book, by his experience in writing in briefer
form stories meant to aid in the study of Roman history in
schools and colleges,—his parallel readings have been widely
used by other teachers. <i>A Friend of Caesar</i> is a very scholarly
piece of work by a very scholarly man; and it is absolutely
accurate in its history, presenting everything which
a school-boy may be expected to learn in his study of Roman
history and life of a definite period. Yet, while it is very
slightly expurgated of grosser elements, it is in no sense a
book for boys alone, but a <i>novel</i> which can satisfy the taste
of the most mature readers. Mr. Davis has thus succeeded
in combining, in a single volume, elements which
other authors have found it very difficult to combine. <i>A
Friend of Caesar</i> is in fact a novel of Roman life in the best
sense in which that phrase can be used. As Mr. Davis
says in his preface to the novel, “If this book serves to show
that classical life presented many phases akin to our own,
it will not have been written in vain.” This sentence shows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the highest possible conception of the function of the historical
novel. In portraying life at Rome at the time of the
fall of the Roman Republic, Mr. Davis (in his preface) disparages
his own work in comparison with that in <i>Quo
Vadis</i>; he says that he is taking the pagan point of view
rather than the Christian. But, judged purely from a consideration
of the necessity for accurate scholarship, <i>A
Friend of Caesar</i> is a far more thorough work than <i>Quo
Vadis</i>; and, while containing a number of scenes of great
dramatic value, it does not rely unduly on the melodramatic
and the sensational. In matters requiring minute
and careful scholarship, it is possible that Mr. Davis goes
too far; there are times when the reader feels that it is
becoming <i>too much</i> a school-book. Yet this insistence on
detail, while leading to possible faults, also assures the principal
virtue of <i>A Friend of Caesar</i>, its absolute reliability.</p>

<p>Julius Caesar himself is the most important figure in this
novel. The finest and noblest points in the character of this
great man, among the world’s great men, are emphasized;
while his defects are entirely left out of the picture. The
resulting character of Caesar in the book is thus idealized
to some extent, but perhaps not too much so for the purpose
of a novel. Caesar appears as the hero, great statesman,
and controller of the world’s destinies that he was. The
technical hero of the story is Quintus Livius Drusus, and
he is a typical boy’s hero; his history is given in a way
which arouses interest and associates him closely, in the
reader’s mind, with Caesar. Cleopatra seems to have been
an important character in the author’s mind, mainly because
she played an important part in history. Her personality
is viewed in a somewhat more attractive light than
might be expected, and as a character she blends well with
the idealized character of Caesar. The weaker side of Pompeius’
character is emphasized, and he is not brought into
the foreground enough to be considered a really important
character. The manner of his death is well portrayed in
ch. XXII, “The End of the Magnus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most notable scene in <i>A Friend of Caesar</i> is
the historical one in the Curia. In this the destinies of the
Roman Republic are shown to be in the hands of its own
unscrupulous government, just as much as they are later in
the hands of Caesar; this scene is truly great, and contains
no apparent inconsistencies. The scene in which Agias is
saved by Fabia, is modelled somewhat on a similar scene
between Onesimus and a Vestal in Canon Farrar’s <i>Darkness
and Dawn</i>, as Mr. Davis candidly says in his preface.
The scene depicting the riot in Alexandria, especially the
passage which shows how little the brutal Roman soldiers
care for the lives of the poorer citizens, recalls a similar
scene in <i>Hypatia</i>. But <i>A Friend of Caesar</i> contains very
little direct borrowing from previous novels of Roman life,
and does not rely too much upon historical events as a
means of obtaining realistic effect. The scene in which
trusty old Mamercus guards the door of the villa, is a masterpiece
in its description of hand-to-hand fighting, and
excels, in its realism, the description of the actual battle
between the forces of Caesar and those of Pompey. In its
portrayal of character, and its presentation of realistic
scenes, <i>A Friend of Caesar</i> is a novel which rests firmly
upon its own merits.</p>

<p>George Manville Fenn was not a teacher, but his book for
boys, <i>Marcus, the Young Centurion</i>, (1904), is given passing
mention here, since, like Mr. Davis’s novel, it deals with
Julius Caesar. Fenn’s book tells something of Caesar’s
campaigns in Gaul, but a far better book on this subject is
<i>The Standard Bearer; a Story of Army Life in the Time of
Caesar</i>, (1915), by Mr. Albert Carleton Whitehead. This
book tells very realistically the story given in Caesar’s
<i>Commentaries</i>, but is rather a book for boys than a novel of
Roman life.</p>

<p><i>The Unwilling Vestal</i>, (1918), by Mr. Edward Lucas
White, a teacher and thorough scholar of Baltimore, Maryland,
was quite evidently written to show that life in
ancient Rome was essentially “modern.” While this novel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
mentions historical events, such as the campaigns of Marcus
Aurelius, and gives a most striking portrayal of the
effects of the great pestilence at Rome, it does not attempt
to narrate historical details so much, as to make the life and
customs of ancient Rome seem familiar and real to the
modern reader. It has achieved this latter purpose by
presenting Roman life chiefly as it affects a single character,
Brinnaria the Vestal. It is true that the figure of
Marcus Aurelius appears in the novel, and at the close of
the book Commodus plays an important part; Almo, the
charioteer, is a character of whom we hear much at second-hand,
but we seldom make a closer acquaintance with
him, and even the descriptions of his fights in the amphitheatre
are lacking in realistic effect. The Vestals, with
whom Brinnaria is later associated, are given natural and
human qualities, but do not play any very important part.
<i>The Unwilling Vestal</i> is a character-study, a study of one
character. The other characters are important only as they
influence the principal one. Moreover, the varied scenes of
Roman life which are portrayed center about the principal
character. Hence, most of them have to do with the life
of a Vestal. This is shown to be far from a narrow or
confining life. In addition, the author seems justified in
selecting for his Vestal a person so independent, self-willed,
and unusual as Brinnaria. Her parents play little part in
the story, and from the very first, she shows a disposition
to “go it alone.” By devoting so much attention to Brinnaria,
and emphasising her human qualities, whether virtues
or faults, the author has succeeded in making us feel
that we know Brinnaria well. It seems to be a part of the
author’s purpose to convince us that Brinnaria and her
chum Flexinna are not essentially different from the modern
American girls we see and know; and so he gives us a
thorough acquaintance with Brinnaria, the girl, before
introducing us to Brinnaria, the Vestal. There are no
really great scenes in <i>The Unwilling Vestal</i>. In attempting
to recall any such, one thinks at once of the scenes in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
amphitheatre; but here, as elsewhere, we are concerned
with Brinnaria, her feelings, and her interests.</p>

<p>While Almo, the charioteer, comes before us directly only
a few times, the story, (indirectly told), of his career as
charioteer, gladiator, villicus, and King of the Grove, affords
opportunity to throw interesting sidelights on things that
took place here and there in the world of the Roman Empire.
For example, a concise and accurate account of the
way in which the racing companies were managed, is given.
An interesting account is given of Brinnaria’s occupations
inside the Temple of Vesta, and, as has already been indicated,
it is shown that, besides being a Vestal, she was an
important figure in the social life of Rome. The author
says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>She took great delight in mixing in society merely for society’s sake. Moderns
are likely to imagine that the Vestals of ancient Rome were nuns, or
something like nuns. They were nothing of the sort. They were maiden
ladies of wealth and position, whose routine duties brought them into familiar
association with all the men important in the Roman government, hierarchy,
nobility, and gentry, and with their wives and daughters.</p>

</div>

<p>Though <i>The Unwilling Vestal</i> fails to present some of its
scenes with realistic effect, because of the lack of a sufficient
number of characters of different kinds, its author does portray
some very interesting things in Roman life, through
the medium of a single interesting character and a very
real one. Mr. T. Everett Harré had given a vivid picture
of life in Roman Alexandria, while presenting only one
important character, in <i>Behold the Woman</i>, (1916), two
years before; but the character of Mary, while intensely
human, is not intended to show especially “modern” traits
of character. Brinnaria in <i>The Unwilling Vestal</i>, is made
to seem in some ways more familiar to the modern reader,
and more like his modern acquaintances, than any other
single character in any novel of Roman life, written before
Mr. White’s book. Besides being an interesting novel, <i>The
Unwilling Vestal</i> is so accurate in its description of Roman
life and custom that it could be used as a schoolbook of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
great value. Finally, the so-called “modern scientific
touch” is given in the crucial scene of the story, in which
Brinnaria exonerates herself by carrying water in a sieve,—something
which the author had seen done in a series of
accurate experiments. <i>The Unwilling Vestal</i> is original in
style, and does not seem to depend on previous novels of
Roman life in any way. Its omission of any mention of
the Christians, makes it easier for the author to portray
truthfully the life of Pagan Rome.</p>

<p>In <i>The Unwilling Vestal</i>, (1918), Mr. White had told
many interesting things about Roman life, but in limiting
himself to a single important character, whose experiences
are narrated in the third person, he sometimes had failed
to make the reader feel a share in the life of Rome, as an
eye-witness of the scene, or even a participant in it. Such
a realistic effect he actually attained in <i>Andivius Hedulio,
Adventures of a Roman Nobleman in the Days of the Empire</i>,
(1921). This improvement he brought about in part
by introducing a large number of characters from all ranks
and conditions of Roman society, thus “presenting, in a
narrative fiction, a complete and faithful depiction of all
the phases, high and low, of that life which made up the
grandeur which was Rome.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> And most of the numerous
characters are made just as familiar to the reader as
Brinnaria had been made in <i>The Unwilling Vestal</i>. But
this is not the only means taken by the author to make his
novel realistic; and the realistic effect is made complete by
the fact that the adventures of Hedulio are narrated in the
first person by a character who has the entire sympathy of
the reader. While not a great believer in newspaper reviews,
I am willing to admit there is some justice in the
high praise made by “G. W. D.” in <i>The Evening Public
Ledger</i>, Philadelphia. After comparing <i>Andivius Hedulio</i>
to <i>Salammbo</i>, he says of Mr. White’s novel, “The history is
so subtly interwoven with the narrative, that it becomes an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
integral part of it. The attention of the reader is concentrated
on the human relations and the characters are men
and women kin with the men and women of the present century.
Mr. White has made the past live as if it were the
present. Or to put it another way, he has abolished time,
and has exhibited to us the unchanging human emotions
playing upon one another in Rome of the second century,
just as they play upon one another in America of the twentieth
century. He has not once yielded to the temptation to
display his eruditions at the expense of the story, a temptation
to which so many learned men succumb when they try
to write historical fiction. They succumb because they lack
the instinct of the story teller, and do not realize that a
novel must be a human drama first, whatever else it may
be, whether a study of manners or of morals or a picture
of the world in a historical epoch.... There is nothing
that people are more interested in than in other people.”</p>

<p>Any adverse criticism of <i>Andivius Hedulio</i> would most
naturally be directed against the somewhat loose construction
of its plot. The plot of the novel imagines the young
Roman nobleman wrongly suspected of conspiring against
the life of the Emperor Commodus. Fleeing for his life, he
passes eleven years in various disguises, never getting very
far from Italy and returning again and again to Rome,
through one chance or another. As the author says in his
<i>Note to the Reader</i>, “The plot ... has a general resemblance
to the ancient <i>Milesian</i> tales; as, for instance, that
on a version of which Shakespeare based his <i>Comedy of
Errors</i>. More definitely it is affiliated with the plot of the
<i>Metamorphoses</i> of Apuleius... Much of the plot shows
derivation from romances of the <i>Picaresco</i> type, or approaching
that type... The atmosphere of the adventures
collectively is indubitably that of the <i>Satiricon</i> of
Petronius, along with much from the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of
Apuleius.” Much of the plot, says Mr. White, came from
his assuming that there was a fashionable litter-craze at
Rome, “a fad of wealthy fops for journeying by litter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
instead of by travelling coach... Much of the minor
incident and local color derives from my saturating myself
with what survives to us of Roman roadbooks.” In a sense
<i>Andivius Hedulio</i> <i>is</i> a romance of the road. In reading the
novel, I was much impressed by the author’s genuine
delight in strange, unexpected, but <i>not improbable</i> adventures,
and was reminded much of certain aspects of the
romances of Robert Louis Stevenson; it was no surprise to
discover later that I had overlooked its dedication “To Robert
Louis Stevenson, who in reading fiction loved ‘The open
road and the bright eyes of danger.’” Moreover Mr.
White, like Stevenson, realized that the best way to tell a
story, especially a story of adventure, is to tell “one thing
after another.” This is the way it was done by the authors
of the <i>Milesians</i>, of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, and of the
“picaresque” romances. Such works have their place in
the line of ancestry of the modern novel, and the author is
entirely justified in using them,—somewhat expurgated,—since
often they portray life in a very realistic way. It
cannot be said that <i>Andivius Hedulio</i> excels such great
novels as <i>Ben Hur</i> and <i>Darkness and Dawn</i>, in portraying
the life of the Roman world with realistic effect. But the
author’s genius, in making the experiences of characters of
the Roman world seem essentially like our own experiences,
and those of our friends, makes this novel excel most other
novels of Roman life in this respect.</p>

<p><i>Andivius Hedulio</i> is the work of a scholarly teacher of
Latin, who wished to throw a strong light on the life of the
historical period of Commodus’ reign; and especially to
present Commodus in the character of “the most perfect
athlete the world ever produced, misplaced on earth’s greatest
throne.” Mr. White’s novel is in no sense a school-history
book, such as Mr. Davis’s <i>A Friend of Caesar</i>; but
any school-boy could read it with pleasure, and learn from
its sound scholarship, much, that would aid him in his classical
studies. Commodus is the most important historical
figure, and, as the author says, the part he plays in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
novel is due in part to what is said of him in the work of
Gibbon, Dio Cassius, and Herodian. While other sources
mentioned by Mr. White in his <i>Note to the Reader</i>, show a
wide reading and a thoroughness of scholarship, the novel
itself is sufficient evidence of this, and is entirely free from
slavish copying. He frankly admits that the culminating
incident in the chariot races originated partly from certain
details in the chariot race in <i>Ben Hur</i>, (1880). But this
incident is given a peculiar originality, by the addition of
details taken from the account given to Mr. White of a
“run-away” accident, which actually occurred in Baltimore.
This illumination of the past, by placing in a story of the
past an incident which has recently occurred, often aids a
novelist in attaining realistic effect, and illustrates one of
the ways Mr. White has taken to make the past seem real
to present-day readers. The labyrinth motive appears in
<i>Andivius Hedulio</i>, when the hero and his faithful servant
make their escape from a secret stair, and through a long,
dark and filthy drain. This incident was suggested by the
escape of Jean Valjean in Victor Hugo’s <i>Les Miserables</i>,
and Baring-Gould may have taken a similar incident in
<i>Perpetua</i> from the same source.</p>

<p>Commodus’ joy in driving his horses to victory in the
chariot races and in displaying his skill in the amphitheatre,
is well portrayed by the author; but perhaps the
greatest stroke in the portrayal of Commodus, is made, not
when he is governing horses, or overcoming single opponents,
animal or human, in the arena, but when he is controlling
the minds and passions of the army of mutineers.
While Commodus is not the technical hero of the story, he
is the real hero of the novel, and in a fine character-study he
is represented as the man who really controlled the Roman
world, whether addressing soldiers and courtiers, or impressing
the populace by his skill in the arena. But besides
presenting life at the court of Commodus and in the higher
social circles at Rome, with which the Emperor was definitely
connected, the novel takes one through the streets of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
Rome and into different quarters of the city, in such a way
as to illustrate the life of all classes of Roman society; and
presents with fairness most of the various types of
human character, which were to be found in the city of
Rome itself and in various parts of the Empire. Since the
Christians were comparatively few in number, even as late
as the time of Commodus, (and the life of Rome was still
essentially pagan), the author wisely refrains from any
attempt to give them a place in his story. He says of
<i>Andivius Hedulio</i>, “Especially I judged it free from vital
anachronisms. I know of no fiction dealing with Rome or
Greece which does not project-back later ideas of duty,
right and wrong, morality and such like ethical concepts,
into periods far anteceding those in which these conceptions
developed. The Greeks and Romans had very definite
notions as to personal morals, decency, duty, and the
like, but many of the ideas most prevalent among us originated
since Roman times and were then non-existent and
inconceivable.” It would be beside the mark to cry “paganism,”
against Mr. White’s <i>Andivius Hedulio</i>, since paganism
is exactly what he wished to portray. In some respects
this novel excels any other previously discussed, in its portrayal
not only of the outward life, but of the <i>social</i> and
<i>ethical</i> atmosphere of pagan Rome. And its teacher-author
has been eminently successful in showing, to school-boy and
mature reader alike, “all the phases, high and low, of that
life which made up the grandeur which was Rome.”</p>

<h3 id="III_H">H. NOVELS WRITTEN BY AUTHORS WHO HAVE PORTRAYED
ROMAN LIFE FROM AN ESTHETIC VIEWPOINT</h3>

<p>Walter Pater’s <i>Marius the Epicurean</i> appeared in 1885.
While Pater was a tutor at Oxford, <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>
is so far removed from being a school-book, that it was
impossible to consider it in the class of novels written by
teachers to illustrate Roman life or a certain period of
Roman history in a pedagogical way. In fact Pater’s work
is so different from most novels of Roman life, and has a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
literary value so much higher than most novels of any kind,
that it is best considered in a class by itself. Nothing has
ever been written exactly like <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>, which
ranks above Pater’s other literary productions, fine as they
are, and furnishes his principal contribution to posterity.
It was indeed written for posterity, and not intended to be
read as an interesting novel and then forgotten. Marius
the Epicurean is the finest piece of pure literature that will
be considered in this study. Moreover it cannot escape consideration
as a novel of Roman life. Its full title is <i>Marius
the Epicurean, His Sensations and Ideas</i>. Its hero is a
Roman boy, who advances in years, until he arrives at
mature manhood, and whose death is recorded at the end
of the story. “It would probably have been called a novel
had its chief claim and merit not been independent of fiction.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
In following the development of Marius, Pater is
showing what might have happened to a young man in the
Rome of Marcus Aurelius, if he were possessed of a particularly
fine esthetic sense, and devoted his life to an
esthetic ideal. There is sufficient binding material in the
form of narrative to make <i>Marius the Epicurean</i> rather a
novel than a series of essays, though it contains fine studies
of the physical and spiritual life of Rome. Such novels of
Roman life as George Gissing’s <i>Veranilda</i>, (1904), and Mr.
Eden Phillpotts’ <i>Pan and the Twins</i>, (1922), have derived
much inspiration from both the substance and quality of
Pater’s work. Such a thorough classical scholar and
ardent lover of the classics as Lionel Johnson could say of
its exactness, in <i>Post Liminium</i>: “Readers, accustomed by
long experience to use <i>Marius</i> for a text-book,—exact, precise,
rigorous, well warranted and attested,—of the Antonine
age, do not need to be told that Mr. Pater never writes
without his facts and evidences.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Pater’s aim in <i>Marius the Epicurean</i> had something in
common with the aim of some of the best novels of Roman
life, that have been considered, however unique his method
may have been. He purposes to show a young man in an
age similar to our own, and one who exhibited “a sort of
religious phase possible for the modern mind.” Marius is
like Pater in his serious and refined nature, and his esthetic
delight in religious ceremonial, but represents better Pater’s
ideal. Though he is taught to believe in the outworn system
of paganism, he takes delight only in the most beautiful
elements in pagan religious ceremonials. In his quest of
the fine and the beautiful in religious emotion, he is led to
higher and higher forms of philosophy, each step in his
development being minutely described by Pater, not with
the accompaniment of abstract philosophizing, but with the
desire to portray in simple terms the beauty of esthetic
experience. At each step toward a higher intellectual existence
Marius approaches the ideal of a Christian life; his
soul is said to be “naturally Christian,” and he admires
elements of beauty in the thought and life of a Christian
comrade. Finally by a mere accident, he dies a Christian.
<i>Marius the Epicurean</i> simply portrays the life of Rome, as
it appeared to a young Roman who lived only to seek the
highest good in esthetic experience. It clearly shows that
life governed by an esthetic ideal, could and did exist in
the days of Marcus Aurelius, just as it can and does exist
today.</p>

<p>In <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>, Pater, as the author, shows
himself to be more a true Hellenist than any writer appears
to be in any novel of Roman life written before Pater’s
work,—though his truly Greek appreciation of the beautiful
is in no way inconsistent with Christianity. But the book
portrays not merely the beauty of Greek philosophy.
Viewed as a portrayal of life, <i>Marius the Epicurean</i> may be
fairly said to portray essentially the entire course of the
religious life of Rome,—starting with the primitive and
patriarchal “religion of Numa,” and passing through later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
forms, (whether wholly Roman or including foreign elements);
and further on through the abstractions of Greek
philosophy, to the highest form of Christianity. The social
and moral phenomena to be seen at Rome in the times of
Marcus Aurelius, are shown, and the part which great
schools of Greek philosophy played in the life of Rome, is
made to appear important.</p>

<p>While no great character portrayals are attempted in
<i>Marius the Epicurean</i>, Marius is made to meet with such
great characters as the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Apuleius,
and Lucian. Marcus Aurelius is portrayed in a very modern
light as a public lecturer, through whose example
Marius determines to become a student of rhetoric at Rome;
yet to Marius he seemed to be, (as he actually was), the
greatest thinker and the greatest man of his time. In his
representation of the character of Faustina, who is seen
surrounded by her children, including the supposedly illegitimate
Commodus, Pater may owe something to Swinburne’s
poem, <i>Faustine</i>. Roman customs are well represented,
when we see people performing sacrifices or going
to the theatre to celebrate a holiday; and the life of Rome
is made to seem real by minute descriptive touches, such as
those which describe the evidences of the ravages of the
great pestilence. Roman shops, inns, temples, and other
buildings appear crowded with people, and a multitude of
human types are shown, as soldiers, courtesans, beggars
and little children. Some description is also made of a
Roman marriage ceremony; and the mythological burlesques
and gladiatorial contests of the amphitheatre are
described as affecting different individuals in different ways.
In the death of Verus appears something of the spirit
which made the Romans turn such a matter into a public
event; the great Galen, making his way through the throng
to the side of the sufferer, is a figure which is familiar
elsewhere in the novel of Roman life.</p>

<p>But the most characteristic scenes taken from the outward
life of the Romans’ are the banquet and the Triumph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
of Marcus Aurelius. Pater adds to the reality of these
Roman scenes by portraying not only the characteristics of
men, but also those of children, and even animals. Thus in
the triumphal procession go “the ibex, the wild-cat, and the
reindeer stalking and trumpeting grandly.” Though scenes
of the martyrdom of the Christians only appear as told at
second-hand, a characteristic Roman brutality is shown by
the guards in charge of Christian prisoners. Thus the material
life of Rome, as well as its religious life, is portrayed
in <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>. What Pater did for the novel of
Roman life was to show the possibility of portraying not
merely the material existence of the Romans, but the whole
life of Rome considered from a religious and esthetic standpoint.
<i>Marius the Epicurean</i> has been said to stand without
fiction; but the highest hope of any fiction might well
be to rise to the level of Pater’s work. It took five or six
years to write, and shows Pater’s thorough scholarship, and
his appreciation of the beautiful in Latin and Greek literature.
Mr. Edward Hutton sums up its excellence when
he says that, “In <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>, Pater gave us a
book profound and simple, bounded by the great refusals
of an artist, perfect in prose, stooping to nothing, having
the dignity of a great poem, and the thoughtfulness that is
characteristic of the writers of the Augustan age.”</p>

<p>George Gissing in <i>Veranilda</i>, (1904), seems to be the
first author of a novel of Roman life to derive much inspiration
from Pater’s <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>, (1885). Gissing
resembles Pater in his exact scholarship, his love of Greek
things, and his estheticism. <i>Veranilda</i> was to have in it
the love of the classics, but is unfinished. Yet it is evident
that only a few chapters at the end are missing, and what
we have of <i>Veranilda</i> is finished with Gissing’s finest and
most delicate touches. The late Mr. Frederic Harrison says
of Gissing in the preface to <i>Veranilda</i>, that in this novel,
“his poetical gift for local color, his subtle insight into
spiritual mysticism and, above all, his really fine scholarship
and classical learning had ample field.” Mr. Harrison<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
considers <i>Veranilda</i> “far the most important book which
George Gissing ever produced,” and most readers of Gissing
will concur in this opinion. Though the subject-matter of
<i>Veranilda</i> is somewhat different from that of <i>Marius the
Epicurean</i>, there is much similarity between the two books
in the way subjects are presented, and at times Gissing’s
purity of style approaches that of Pater. In many respects
<i>Veranilda</i> is the greatest novel of its kind. Not only does
it show thoroughness and accuracy in scholarship, but it
has very genuine characterization and atmosphere. The
spirit of <i>Veranilda</i> is the spirit of the time it describes,—the
spirit of disillusion, unrest, and uncertainty amid scenes
of strife, sorrow, and decay. Yet there are gleams of hope
to be found in Gissing’s great novel, which portrays life in
and near Rome in the “Era of Justinian.” While the outward,
physical life of fallen Rome is portrayed accurately,
as it would appear to the eye, the special excellence of
<i>Veranilda</i> lies in its exact reproduction of the spirit of the
time with which it deals. In this respect it probably excels
any other historical novel in English,—bar none,—and deserves
a high position as pure literature. Moreover in his
portrayal of life in the past, Gissing has not failed to establish
its connection with life of the present; realistic effect is
never lacking in <i>Veranilda</i>. Yet even when portraying life
in the most general terms, Gissing continually shows the
same selection and preference for the esthetic, the same
search for the beautiful, which marks the work of Walter
Pater in <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>.</p>

<p>The plan of <i>Veranilda</i> is more complete than that of most
historical novels; it deals chiefly with real historical characters
and actual historical events, yet there is not too much
formal history in the novel. It was carefully written after
a most thorough study of the best modern writers, (especially
Gibbon), who deal with the age of Justinian and
Belisarius, and of the remains of the literature of the time.
The scene is Rome and Central and Southern Italy, and
local color is obtained not at second-hand, but from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
author’s direct observation of the places he describes, and a
careful review of extant documents concerning them. Gissing
had spent some time travelling in Italy and <i>Veranilda</i>
may be considered his most original novel. In selecting
the scene and the time of <i>Veranilda</i>, Gissing evidently intended
to write a novel which should convey a sense of
Rome’s former greatness. The center and source of power
of the Roman Empire had shifted to Constantinople, though
even here the power of Rome was none too strong. Felix
Dahn’s two novels, <i>A Struggle for Rome</i>, (1876), and <i>The
Scarlet Banner</i>, (1894), deal with the same period with
which <i>Veranilda</i> deals; <i>The Scarlet Banner</i> being concerned
with the overthrow of the Vandal king, Gelimer, by Belisarius.
<i>A Struggle for Rome</i>, is like <i>Veranilda</i> in its subject
matter, since it is concerned with the struggle between the
Ostrogoths and Belisarius, and mentions some of the same
characters that appear in <i>Veranilda</i>. The characterization
of Totila, the Gothic king, especially suggests <i>Veranilda</i>.
But while <i>A Struggle for Rome</i> is Dahn’s greatest novel, it
does not appear that Gissing was so much indebted to it in
<i>Veranilda</i>, as to original historical sources. The period
with which <i>Veranilda</i> deals comes somewhat after the true
end of Pagan Rome, and no novel will be discussed which
deals with a later period.</p>

<p>Gissing preserves a fine unity of effect in making the
events of his story center about Rome, and not about Constantinople.
“The Eternal City” lies there as of old, and
its inhabitants cannot shake off the feeling that it still is
“eternal.” The wise Justinian is to them a foreign tyrant,
under whose governor they are harshly oppressed. The
great commander Belisarius, though he has temporarily defeated
the Goths, has now left Italy, and is no longer
thought of as deliverer of Rome; the fame of Totila is
spreading. Throughout this book, with its descriptions of
ruined towns, ruined families, and the ruins of the City of
Rome itself, one feels the former greatness of Rome.
Everywhere is decay, everywhere is to be seen a dying out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
of the best elements of Roman civilization. Many of the
scenes which form the setting for the principal action in the
story, are typical of this lingering death of the great city.
While everywhere the old Rome is dying out, is there springing
up anything new to take its place? Even though the
novel is incomplete, one can see that the author means to
show conclusively that the Goths will furnish new life, and
new strength, to Rome and to civilization.</p>

<p>In <i>Hypatia</i>, Kingsley had portrayed “the dying world” of
Rome, especially in the chapter headed by that phrase. In
<i>Marius the Epicurean</i>, Pater had pointed out the coming
downfall of Rome in several different ways. He had said,
for example, that the Germanic tribes, whom Marcus
Aurelius defeated, were merely the advance guard of a vast
body of wandering tribes destined to overrun the Roman
world. Marcus Aurelius in his triumph over the Germans,
appeared to Marius, “chiefly as one who had made the great
mistake,” as a man who had failed. “The most Christian”
Stoic Emperor, in pursuing his thoroughly Roman policy
of enforcing worship of the gods with an iron hand at
Rome, and ruthlessly subjugating peoples on the frontiers
of the Empire, had failed to save Rome from becoming
more and more a nation of “coarse, vulgar people,” an
Empire that failed. In <i>Veranilda</i> we see the impressive
remains of that great failure. Its psychology, like that of
most of Gissing’s work, is the psychology of failure. As
the decayed condition of his old home appears to be symbolic
of failure to Marius, near the end of <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>,
so all through <i>Veranilda</i> the decay of material
things seems to symbolize the downfall and death of “Eternal
Rome.” Yet the gleams of hope, which appear through
the gloom, are symbolic of a new life. While no such large
contrast is made in <i>Veranilda</i>, as is made in <i>Hypatia</i>, the
hope of Christianity in a failing world is made very real.</p>

<p>Aside from the scene depicting the murder at the villa,
there are few sensational scenes in <i>Veranilda</i>. Moreover,
in most of the scenes of importance, it is noticeable that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
only a limited number of people appear. The greater part
of the novel is pitched in a minor key. There are countless
incidents of importance, whisperings, doubts, uncertainties;
trivial words often have a hidden meaning, trifling
actions assume great importance. The remains of Rome’s
grandeur are suggested in the character of Flavius Anicius
Maximus, a worthy descendant of an ancient and noble
family; and his sister Petronilla serves to keep before our
minds something of the uncompromising pride of any
descendant of an old Roman family. A similar pride appears
in the characters of the Deacon Leander and Vigilius.
But more fitting messengers of God are the holy Abbott
Benedict and his monks. The scenes about the monastery
are drawn with a masterful touch; one feels the genuine
influence for good, which the holy Abbott has over Basil,
and the real help which he gives to Basil, in the difficulty
with which Basil is confronted. St. Benedict appears as a
man who leads a genuinely spiritual life, with insight
enough to solve all of Basil’s difficulties.</p>

<p>Veranilda herself is a truly radiant figure, and it is in
justice that the novel is named for her. She does not often
appear upon the scene, it is true, but the sincerity of her
character and her overwhelming loveliness are drawn with
convincing strokes. Her innocence at all times, especially
when in Marcian’s power, and her faith in those into whose
care she is entrusted, are points of strength in her character,
not of weakness; and she proves herself truly great in
her forgiveness of Basil. In his delineation of character
especially, Gissing has at times equalled the exquisite
touches of Pater. How little is told of St. Benedict or of
Veranilda, yet how definitely their characters are impressed
upon the reader! Veranilda is beyond question, the character
who best represents beauty of body and soul, in the
novel of Roman life, and, I believe, surpasses Pater’s Marius
in representing a “soul naturally Christian.” In any case,
one feels that in <i>Veranilda</i>, as in <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
there always exists the esthetic conception of an inseparable
connection between physical and spiritual beauty. Gissing
followed Pater in showing that the life of Rome could be
portrayed as being far from entirely physical and material;
and he showed more definitely than Pater, that Roman
life could be presented in the form of a novel, with realistic
effect, yet with the exercise of a discriminating selection of
the finer elements of subject matter, and in a style delicately
fitted to portray these finer elements.</p>

<p>A review of esthetic elements to be found in the novel of
Roman life would not be complete without some consideration
of two recent novels by Mr. Eden Phillpotts, <i>Evander</i>,
(1919), and <i>Pan and the Twins</i>, (1922). Mr. Phillpotts
has shown his appreciation for classic art in <i>The Joy of
Youth</i>, while another of his novels, <i>The River</i>, shows his
love for the beautiful in nature. Mr. George Moore says,
“Morality is but a dream, but beauty is real;” his novel,
<i>The Brook Kerith</i>, is not considered here as a novel of
Roman life, but in it the author often harks back to the
beautiful pagan world. There is something of this in the
two novels of Roman life written by Mr. Phillpotts. As
has been said, George Ebers had written, <i>A Question; The
Idyl of a Picture by His Friend Alma Tadema</i>, (1881),
which presents the beauties of pastoral life in semi-mythological
classic times in pre-historic Sicily, and suggests
<i>Evander</i> in subject matter. In <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>, Pater
had said, “Farm life in Italy, including the culture of the
olive and the vine, has a grace of its own, and might well
contribute to the production of an ideal dignity of character,
like that of nature itself in this gifted region. Vulgarity
seemed impossible.” The ideal beauty of a simple, outdoor
life, centering in the farmer’s hut, appears in <i>Evander</i>, a
novel which portrays life in prehistoric Italy and abounds
in beautiful pastoral description. In its portrayal of life,
<i>Evander</i> shows somewhat the same discriminating selection
of esthetic elements to be seen in <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
and <i>Veranilda</i>; but unlike the work of Pater or Gissing,
<i>Evander</i> has a rich and picturesque humor. Here, in Mr.
Phillpotts’ novel, is optimism in contrast to the detachment
of Pater, and Gissing’s somewhat continuous pessimism.
Mr. Phillpott’s light, humorous, cheerful style in
<i>Evander</i>, makes the novel rank far below <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>
and <i>Veranilda</i> as a work of art, and is a concession
to popular taste; yet it has a virtue of its own. Many
readers, who would find <i>Marius the Epicurean</i> too serious,
could read <i>Evander</i> with pleasure and profit.</p>

<p><i>Evander</i> portrays life in Italy when marriage was just
coming into fashion; it is really a satire of the “triangle”
of the ordinary man, the genius, and the woman who does
not know her own mind. But it truthfully represents the
beginnings of things most characteristically Roman; especially
the Roman ideals of the home, the community, and
finally law, ideals which sprang from the simple, austere,
agricultural life of the prehistoric Romans. The author is
right in representing as real to these primitive Romans,
“nymphs, goat-foot fauns and other immortal creatures of
lake and mountain, vale and forest, who spied upon humanity
with wonder when the world was young.” Among other
gods, Pan, under the Latin name of Faunus, appears to a
mortal woman, in <i>Evander</i>, as he had done in Mr. James
Stephens’ novel, <i>The Crock of Gold</i>; and the humorous, delicately
satiric style of <i>Evander</i> at times suggests Mr. Stephen’s
work. In portraying life “when the world was
young,” the author of <i>Evander</i> seems to ask, “Why should
it grow old?” And in portraying ancient pagan life as a
satire on modern life, he does not fail to show that the
ideals and aspirations of man have changed but little.</p>

<p><i>Pan and the Twins</i>, (1922), as its title suggests, makes a
similar use of the god Pan, and is a novel written in a style
similar to that of <i>Evander</i>. It differs from Mr. Phillpotts’
other novel of Roman life in including historical material.
Not very much history is brought into <i>Pan and the Twins</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
but when historical events are mentioned, they are made
vividly significant, and are rightly interpreted. The scene
is laid chiefly on a country estate near Rome, and in the
time of Valentinian, though other Roman Emperors are
mentioned. Even more than <i>Evander</i>, <i>Pan and the Twins</i>
suggests Mr. James Stephens’ <i>The Crock of Gold</i>, but is a
better constructed novel and a finer piece of art. The satire
of <i>Pan and the Twins</i> is delicate but very pointed at times,
as when Theodosius convinces the Christian bishop that it
is not his duty to the State to have Arcadius burned alive.
Its humor is equally delicate, but no one could fail to laugh
at the spectacle of one of the Emperor’s favorite bears,
which escapes from its cage at the amphitheatre and becomes
very much worried that “malefactors” are no longer
provided as its daily food.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>While its philosophy is at times “sugar-coated,” <i>Pan and
the Twins</i> offers a very strong plea for sanity in religion
and life, and suggests that they are one and the same thing.
Moreover, in its portrayal of life, it distinctly seeks for elements
of beauty. With a few delicate touches, the author
presents in his heroine a figure of ideal physical and spiritual
beauty, not unlike Gissing’s Veranilda in conception.
In portraying Roman life, coarser elements are kept in the
background. One is made to feel the existence of the horrors
of the amphitheatre, the inconsistencies of the Church,
and much of the varied life of Rome. Roman customs, as,
for example, the marriage ceremony, are correctly described.
But in the foreground of the picture appear
always scenes amid the sunlight and pure air of the Roman
country landscape. <i>Pan and the Twins</i> is not a great
novel, but one that contains much beautiful writing. The
scenes which it portrays are selected chiefly for their
esthetic appeal, but are real, none the less; not inconsistent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
with life, past or present. It is not necessarily either
“pagan” or Christian; but seems to undertake to show that
beauty cannot be defined entirely in terms of morality,
Christianity, or paganism. <i>Pan and the Twins</i> ranks far
below such a consummate piece of art as <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>,
but successfully presents the esthetic, in terms
more readily appreciated by the popular taste.</p>

<span class="smcap">In Conclusion</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In thus reviewing the principal lines of development
which the novel of Roman life has followed to the present
day, it has been found that, in some cases, these lines lead
away ultimately from the true type of the novel which portrays
the life of Rome with realistic effect. Thus the line
of the novel of Roman life as written by scholarly preachers
has been found to branch off, at a certain point, into the line
of the story of religious instruction, a form which was
excluded by definition in Section I of this study. The line
of the “popular” novel of Roman life has always had a tendency
to branch off, and deteriorate into cheap imitations,
which attempt to use Roman life to provide artificial coloring,
but do not really portray Roman life at all. The line
of the novel of Roman life written to illustrate “schoolbook”
history has in most cases branched off directly into
the line of books for boys—Mr. Davis’s and Mr. White’s
novels being the notable exceptions. While there has been
little direct imitation of the pedantic elements in the work
of German scholars, with their meticulous overemphasis
upon detail; German novelists such as Eckstein have been
shown to follow Scott in their methods of writing historical
novels, and to suggest in turn to English novelists, the thorough
way in which subjects taken from Roman life may be
presented by any novelist. Few English novelists have attained
notable success in portraying Roman life in terms
which suggest the purity of style and beauty of thought of
Pater’s <i>Marius the Epicurean</i>.</p>

<p>The two English novels of Roman life, which have had
the most profound influence upon other English novels of
Roman life, are Kingsley’s <i>Hypatia</i> and Wallace’s <i>Ben Hur</i>;
and one must look to these two especially, in any attempt
to trace the lines of development which are of the most
supreme importance, in the English novel of Roman life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
Since the publication of these two books, <i>Quo Vadis</i> has had
a very important effect upon the English novel of Roman
life, but this book followed Canon Farrar’s <i>Darkness and
Dawn</i>, which in turn followed Eckstein’s <i>Nero</i>. The importance
of <i>Hypatia</i> and <i>Ben Hur</i>, in the development of the
novel of Roman life, is due principally to the clear relation
which they establish between the life of the Roman world
and the life of today, and to their illustration of eternal
truths. It must be emphasized that novels such as these
give one a comprehensive idea of life throughout the Roman
world; <i>Ben Hur</i> is most successful in this, but the scenes
in <i>Hypatia</i>, though chiefly laid in Alexandria, are symbolic
of Roman life in a larger sphere. A few novels of Roman
life have attained, in some measure, the success of <i>Hypatia</i>
and <i>Ben Hur</i>, by portraying life in a number of different
parts of the Roman world. But most novelists have done
better work by limiting the scene of their novels to the
vicinity of the City of Rome itself, while not attempting
work upon such large outlines as those upon which the
work of Charles Kingsley and Lew Wallace is based. It
has been found that novels whose scene is laid chiefly outside
of and apart from any great city of the Roman world,—especially
those whose scene is in one of the remote provinces
of the Roman Empire,—do not really portray Roman
life. This has been found to be the case with novels whose
scene is Roman Britain, since they merely present very elementary
illustrations of school-book history, and do not
portray the life of Rome at all.</p>

<p>In general, the novel of Roman life has been found to be
a very elastic form, and this has necessitated a certain
looseness of structure in the section treating of its development,
(Sec. III); but especial care has been taken not to
omit significant elements in this development, and not to
set up arbitrary standards of value. The principal lines of
development, which the novel of Roman life has followed,
and which I have endeavored to trace carefully, have not
converged up to the present time; this study has therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
been devoted to an analysis of important individual
elements, rather than to an attempt to construct from these
elements a complete whole, based upon any abstract theory,
and having a merely superficial unity. All elements of
permanent value in the novel of Roman life have been given
an entirely thorough consideration, the combination of a
number of important elements in great novels has been
pointed out; but the possibility of a further combination
of these important elements into an even greater novel of
Roman life than any which has yet been written, is something
which the future alone can realize. While, for the
sake of completeness, it has been necessary to review a number
of inferior novels; these have, in most cases, been used
to illustrate definite tendencies in particular lines of development
of the novel of Roman life; or to mark the exact
points at which such particular lines of development pass
outside the limits of the field of the true novel of Roman
life.</p>

<p>It is sincerely hoped that this study will serve as a complete
and unbiased review of all the best work that has
been done in the novel of Roman life. This work has been
shown to be one requiring scholarship of the highest order,
and offering to the reader products, whose literary merit
compares favorably with that of the best work produced in
other departments of the historical novel. In portraying
life in the past with realistic effect, the novel of Roman life
has been shown to be a direct development of the historical
novel, a literary form which has in all important respects
followed the example of Sir Walter Scott, and which has
continued to show evidences of vigor and power to the
present time. The life of ancient Rome has been shown
to offer to the English historical novelist a field rich in
material which illustrates the vital connection between the
life of the past and the life of the present.</p>

that she typifies the last adherent of Greek philosophy, and this is the real
reason she is chosen. There is, however, a marked similarity between Kingsley’s
heroine and Ware’s Zenobia. Both were women who aspired to power,
independent of the Roman government; and both conceived the idea of relying
on male counselors. Hypatia, in speaking of Philammon, says: “If I could
but train him into a Longinus, I could dare to play the part of a Zenobia, with
him as counselor... And for my Odenatus—Orestes?” She did indeed
attempt to follow this plan, even forming an alliance with Orestes, whom
she detested. But even if Kingsley’s heroine was in part suggested to him by
Ware’s Zenobia, this is not to be considered an important reason leading to
the writing of <i>Hypatia</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Explanation</i></h3>

<p>The following list of titles will be divided into sections,
according to the plan followed in tracing the development of
the novel of Roman life, and is intended to serve as a supplement
to Section III of the foregoing study. In each section
of the list the titles will be arranged, as nearly as possible,
according to the chronological order of the dates of
publication, except in cases where an author has written
more than one fiction on Roman life. In such cases all his
books will be mentioned together in the order of their publication.
In case the original date of publication of a book
is uncertain, the date of the best available edition will be
given; or if no date is known for a book, it will be listed at
the end of the section in which it belongs, or after other
books, (the date of which is known), by the same author.
In some cases title will be listed of books which are out of
print but may be found here and there in public libraries.
Books which I believe are practically unobtainable will be
marked with an asterisk (*). The list includes all true
English novels of Roman life, as well as all other books
written in English, whose titles have been collected as by-products
of the novel of Roman life. These by-products
will be classified according to their relative importance to
the study of the novel of Roman life, the more important
books being given first.</p>

<p>The earliest known date of each novel is given in parentheses,
(). Short stories, including those published in collections,
have been omitted.</p>
